@platz-kopiez-meta-analysis-2012 found an effect size of Cohen's $d=0.51$ in
their meta-analysis of audio-visual presentation compared to audio-only
presentation of music performances.
They considered studies from 1940 to 2010 with dependent variables such as
"liking", "expressiveness", "overall quality", and "overall impression".

This repository contains material to extend the original meta-analysis.
