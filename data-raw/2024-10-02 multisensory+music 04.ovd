AB  - Musical structure is complex, consisting of a small set of elements that combine to form hierarchical levels of pitch and temporal structure according to grammatical rules. As with language, different systems use different elements and rules for combination. Drawing on recent findings, we propose that music acquisition begins with basic features, such as peripheral frequency-coding mechanisms and multisensory timing connections, and proceeds through enculturation, whereby everyday exposure to a particular music system creates, in a systematic order of acquisition, culture-specific brain structures and representations. Finally, we propose that formal musical training invokes domain-specific processes that affect salience of musical input and the amount of cortical tissue devoted to its processing, as well as domain-general processes of attention and executive functioning.

AB  - The tradition of visiting the sick is a practice that brings comfort to patients who are suffering, offers prayers for healing, and keeps the connection with family and community alive. It is a practice recognized from ancient times through today, one which underscores the mission of the field of Pastoral Care. This paper describes the creative use of multi-sensory spiritual tools, such as music, singing, personal prayer, psalms, and traditional texts, to enhance the sick visit to the hospitalized patient. This brief structured model is replicable and teachable to lay and professional caregivers. Both patient, family members, and caregivers can benefit from sharing in these moments of inner spiritual attunement and connection with others.

AB  - The studies included within this dissertation work addressed how the human brain adaptively combines information from different senses in order to make the best use of what may be a less-than-ideal scenario within any one sense. In the first series of studies, subjects used a laser pointer within a dark room to locate lights, sounds, or light-sound combinations presented around them; they did so both in conditions of normal vision, and while wearing vision-blurring glasses. Additionally, subjects were tested on the effects of blurred vision using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Intriguingly, we found that not only did subjects show different strategies in dealing with impaired vision, but also that this was related to different patterns of activity within sensory cortex of the brain. In conjunction with this, poorer performance from having blurred vision was readily overcome by use of the combined visual-auditory signal. An additional study investigated the impact of specialized long-term training on this type of interactions, in which we tested trained music conductors within a similar task. We found that, interestingly, their ability to locate sounds in space was greatly improved relative to non-musicians, and they also showed an "enhancement" with combined visual-auditory stimuli that is not observed in the general population. A separate series of studies examined how the brain combines information from different senses when it occurs very close together in time, and how this process might be altered in dyslexic individuals. In these studies, subjects performed a visual discrimination task that also involved sounds occurring at a slightly different time. We found that not only did the inclusion of these sounds alter subjects' perceptual acuity, but also that this effect normally occurs only under very specific conditions of visual-auditory synchrony (i.e., when almost simultaneous). However, dyslexic subjects, who have been shown previously to have auditory discrimination difficulties, display a very different trend---the "multisensory" effect is observed under almost all conditions tested. Through the use of fMRI, we were able to describe the physiological basis of this effect, and propose how an altered neural architecture in dyslexia might relate to the reading disorders commonly associated with these individuals.

AB  - The human body has long inspired artists, philosophers, musicians, and writers. Researchers in the psychological sciences, however, have only relatively recently begun to acknowledge the role the body plays in perception and cognition. With the general notion of cognition recently broadening to include its embodied nature, researchers' accounts of perception have increasingly come to include the body's special status as a window on the world and to accommodate the specific perceptual requirements for identifying, interpreting, and interacting with other bodies. This volume presents a comprehensive overview of the rapid progress that has been made in understanding the human body and its relationship to perception. It will help to unify the relevant research from several independent areas of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience and facilitate the development of an integrated framework for the study of human-body perception. Its sections cover the four major lines of research that have contributed and will continue to contribute to this new framework: body and multimodal perception, body representation, perception of biological motion, and intention and action in body perception. Each chapter provides a state-of-the-art account of exciting theoretical developments and empirical advances, and section introductions integrate the chapters and establish each section's place in the broader context of human-body-perception research. This volume will be an invaluable guide for student and professional researchers in visual perception, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - Evaluation of emotional scenes requires integration of information from different modality channels, most frequently from audition and vision. Neither the psychological nor neural basis of auditory-visual interactions during the processing of affect is well understood. In this study, possible interactions in affective processing were investigated via event-related potential (ERP) recordings during simultaneous presentation of affective pictures (from IAPS) and affectively sung notes that either matched or mismatched each other in valence. To examine the role of attention in multisensory affect-integration ERPs were recorded in two different rating tasks (voice affect rating, picture affect rating) as participants evaluated the affect communicated in one of the modalities, while that in the other modality was ignored. Both the behavioral and ERP data revealed some, although non-identical, patterns of cross-modal influences; modulation of the ERP-component P2 suggested a relatively early integration of affective information in the attended picture condition, though only for happy picture-voice pairs. In addition, congruent pairing of sad pictures and sad voice stimuli affected the late positive potential (LPP). Responses in the voice affect rating task were overall more likely to be modulated by the concomitant picture's affective valence than vice versa.

AB  - Background in musicology: Understanding the gesture-based foundations of musical involvement opens a number of new perspectives for musicology, with the likely effect of a change in approach. Giving justice to the role of gesture in music calls for an integrated view of perception and action, which implies a shift from auditory-based cognition towards embodied cognition, an approach that includes the whole human body as mediator between mental processes and physical energy. Background in computing: With the help of new measurement tools, new computational models of multi-modal interaction, and new interactive multimedia platforms, it becomes easier to study music from a multi-modal point of view, both in terms of scientific and artistic perspectives. Music also offers an appropriate domain for the testing and developing of interactive systems and computational models for handling non-verbal multi-modal communication. Aims: In studying musical gesture, both musicology and engineering can profit from a joint collaboration. While technology provides new tools for the measurement and modelling of musical involvement, knowledge of its corporeal foundation may largely contribute to the development of technology that in turn contributes to measurement and modelling. Furthermore, this knowledge may be exploited in artistic applications. As such, the interaction between musicology and music engineering may lead to interesting developments in the domain of embodied cognition and interactive multimedia platforms. Main contribution: An overview of recent work on the development of an interactive multimedia platform for the measurement and modelling of musical expressiveness is presented. The paper introduces the notion of corporeal imitation and mirroring behavior as a core concept fur understanding musical expressiveness. Implications: The approach advocated in this paper implies a shift of paradigm in systematic musicology, away from an all too narrow focus on auditory perception and sound structure, towards a broader view that encompasses multi-modal musical involvement. This approach is grounded in multi-sensory integration, the coupling of perception and action, the study of motor imitation, and issues that relate to affect, emotions and subjectivity. The advantage of using a interactive multimedia platform for music research, rather than ad hoc solutions, pertains to the use of modular functionalities, which allow rapid prototyping of experimental setup, flexible modelling, and the subsequent use of results in artistic applications.

AB  - Exclusion from the joy of experiencing music, especially in concert venues, is especially applicable to those with an auditory impairment. Limited investigations have been carried out into how to reduce the exclusion for this community in attending classical orchestra music concerts. Through utilizing computer technology and human machine interfaces (sensors and cameras) to stimulate complementary senses through interpretation, reducing this exclusion is possible. Case studies are presented in which multi-sensory, multi-modal interpretation of the music is suggested as able to give new meaning and understanding for such individuals.

AB  - Research has revealed structural and functional differences in the brains of adult instrumental musicians compared to those of matched nonmusician controls, with intensity/duration of instrumental training and practice being important predictors of these differences. Nevertheless, the differential contributions of nature and nurture to these differences are not yet clear. The musician-nonmusician comparison is an ideal model for examining whether and, if so, where such functional and structural brain plasticity occurs, because musicians acquire and continuously practice a variety of complex motor, auditory, and multimodal skills (e.g., translating visually perceived musical symbols into motor commands while simultaneously monitoring instrumental output and receiving multisensory feedback). Research has also demonstrated that music training in children results in long-term enhancement of visual-spatial, verbal, and mathematical performance. However, the underlying neural bases of such enhancements and whether the intensity and duration of instrumental training or other factors, such as extracurricular activities, attention, motivation, or instructional methods can contribute to or predict these enhancements are yet unknown. Here we report the initial results from our studies examining the brain and cognitive effects of instrumental music training on young children in a longitudinal study and a cross-sectional comparison in older children. Further, we present a comparison of the results in these children's studies with observations from our cross-sectional studies with adults.

AB  - One of the requirements for being a successful musical conductor is to be able to locate sounds instantaneously in time and space. Because this requires the integration of auditory and visual information, the purpose of this study was to examine multisensory processing in conductors and a matched set of control subjects. Subjects participated in a series of behavioral tasks, including pitch discrimination, temporal-order judgment (TOJ), and target localization. Additionally, fMRI scans were done on a subset of subjects who performed a multisensory TOJ task. Analyses of behavioral data indicate that, in the auditory realm, conductors were more accurate in both pitch discrimination and TOJs as well as in locating targets in space. Furthermore, these same subjects also demonstrated a benefit from the combination of auditory and visual information that was not observed in control subjects when locating visual targets. Finally, neural substrates in BA 37, 39/40 were identified as potential areas underlying the conductors' superior multisensory TOJs. Data collection and analyses are ongoing and will lead to an improved understanding of multisensory integration in a complex, musical behavior.

AB  - Few empirical studies have examined the human experience of nature. Most research has focused on human response to nature vis-a-vis landscape perception, using photographs or slides in laboratory settings. Questionnaires, rating scales, and physiological indicators have been used to evaluate responses to these simulations. This dissertation addressed the methodological shortcomings of existing research by developing new techniques for studying human transactions with nature in a real-world context. These techniques incorporated multisensory environmental information, visual and extra-visual perception, movement, and the dynamics of time. Hiking was the focus of inquiry, as an outdoor activity which promotes interaction with nature. Members of the Appalachian Mountain Club were recruited to hike a 5-mile trail section in New York's Sterling Forest State Park. Six separate hikes were conducted, each with a different pair of hike partners. One person wore a forehead-mounted microvideo camera to videotape the hike from beginning to end. Both partners wore external microphones to capture conversation and environmental sounds; they were instructed to talk about what they heard, touched, smelled, or saw while hiking. A questionnaire was administered immediately after each hike, and follow-up interviews were conducted to review excerpts from the videotaped hikes (see CD-ROM with sample clips). The HIKEN notation system, similar in design to a musical score, was developed to facilitate analysis of the extensive videotape data. The existing literature served as a heuristic for theoretical analysis. Findings indicate that many assumptions which underlie the traditional approach to this subject need to be revised to accommodate a real-world context. Attention is an area of inquiry that deserves greater emphasis, along with individual differences and changes in human-nature transactions over time and across settings. The hike experience must be studied in terms of kinesthetics and multimodal perception, and challenge is a dimension in need of focused investigation. Analysis of the hike as a sequence of events revealed the quality of "insideness", a subject which can be explored further from a phenomenological perspective. This study also offers preliminary direction for improved design and maintenance of hiking trails, to expand their potential for providing diverse and rewarding nature experience.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

AB  - A central tenet in brain research is that early sensory cortex is modality specific, and, only in exceptional cases, such as deaf and blind subjects or professional musicians, is influenced by other modalities. Here we describe extensive cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex of two monkeys while they performed a demanding auditory categorization task: after a cue light was turned on, monkeys could initiate a tone sequence by touching a bar and then earn a reward by releasing the bar on occurrence of a falling frequency contour in the sequence. In their primary auditory cortex and posterior belt areas, we found many acoustically responsive neurons whose firing was synchronized to the cue light or to the touch or release of the bar. Of 315 multiunits, 45 exhibited cue light-related firing, 194 exhibited firing that was related to bar touch, and 268 exhibited firing that was related to bar release. Among 60 single units, we found one neuron with cue light-related firing, 21 with bar touch-related firing, and 36 with release-related firing. This firing disappeared at individual sites when the monkeys performed a visual detection task. Our findings corroborate and extend recent findings on cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex and suggests that the auditory cortex can be activated by visual and somatosensory stimulation and by movements. We speculate that the multimodal corepresentation in the auditory cortex has arisen from the intensive practice of the subjects with the behavioral procedure and that it facilitates the performance of audiomotor tasks in proficient subjects.

AB  - Tested whether movement influences the auditory encoding of rhythm patterns in human infants. In experiment 1, we trained 7-month-olds by having them listen to a 2-min repetition of an ambiguous (without accented beats) rhythm pattern. Half of the infants were bounced on every second beat, and half on every third beat. After training, infants' listening preferences were tested for two auditory versions of the rhythm pattern. Infants chose to listen longer to the auditory test stimulus with accented beats that matched the beats on which they were bounced. Experiment 2 was identical to experiment 1 except that infants were blindfolded during training. Infants still preferred to listen to the auditory stimulus that matched the metrical form of their movement training, indicating that visual information was not necessary for the effect. Experiment 3 investigated whether personal motion experience was necessary. During training, infants watched without moving as the experimenter bounced either on every second or on every third beat of the ambiguous rhythm pattern. In this case, infants showed no preference for the two auditory versions, indicating that movement of the infant's own body was critical for the multisensory effect observed in experiments 1 and 2. Finally, we tested infants' preferences without any movement training and found no preference for either auditory interpretation, again indicating that movement is crucial for the multisensory effect.

AB  - The underlying causes of the language and literacy difficulties experienced by dyslexic children are not yet fully understood, but current theories suggest that timing deficits may be a key factor. Dyslexic children have been found to exhibit timing difficulties in the domains of language, music, perception and cognition, as well as motor control. The author has previously suggested that group music lessons, based on singing and rhythm games, might provide a valuable multisensory support tool for dyslexic children by encouraging the development of important auditory and motor timing skills and subsequently language skills. In order to examine this hypothesis, a research program was designed that involved the development of group music lessons and musical tests for dyslexic children in addition to three experimental studies. It was found that classroom music lessons had a positive effect on both phonologic and spelling skills, but not reading skills. Results also indicated that dyslexic children showed difficulties with musical timing skills while showing no difficulties with pitch skills. These apparent disassociations between spelling and reading ability and musical timing and pitch ability are discussed. The results of the research program are placed in the context of a more general model of the potential relationship between musical training and improved language and literacy skills.

AB  - Modern concepts emphasize the modular organization of music cognition. According to this viewpoint, different aspects of music are processed in different, although partly overlapping neuronal networks of both hemispheres. However, even when isolating a single 'module', such as, for example, the perception of contours, the interindividual variance of brain substrates is enormous. To clarify the factors contributing to this variability, a longitudinal experiment was conducted comparing the effects of procedural vs explicit music teaching on brain networks. It was demonstrated that cortical activation during music processing reflects the auditory 'learning biography', the personal experiences accumulated over time. Listening to music, learning to play an instrument, formal instruction, and professional training result in multiple, in many instances multisensory, representations of music, which seem to be partly interchangeable and rapidly adaptive. In summary, as soon as we consider 'real music' apart from laboratory experiments, we have to expect individually formed and quickly adaptive brain substrates, including widely distributed neuronal networks in both hemispheres.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare multimodal information processing in the somatosensory and auditory cortices and related multimodal areas in musicians (trumpet players) and non-musicians. Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information. It favors an early stage of cortical processing, which is modified by the connections between multimodal and auditory neurons from thalamus to primary somatosensory area.

AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the effectiveness of 3 mutually exclusive and progressively more active musical conditions to elicit and maintain alert behavior states in children with profound disabilities. Participants were 6 school-age children (aged 7-17 yrs) who had profound disabilities. A within-Ss design was implemented with each S receiving 3 sessions in each of the 3 musical treatment conditions (rhythmic stimulation, song singing, and multisensory rhythm instrument playing) and 3 sessions in the baseline condition. Each session was videotaped and subsequently coded for behavior states according to D. Guess et al's (1990) Behavior State Code. Percentage of time spent in the combined preferred alert states of A1 and A2 for each condition were calculated and compared. Results indicate no significant differences between any of the musical treatment and baseline conditions. Anecdotal evidence from the present study, though, does suggest that this population demonstrated learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - When reviewing the literature on brain substrates of music processing, a puzzling variety of findings can be stated. The traditional view of a left-right dichotomy of brain organization-assuming that in contrast to language, music is primarily processed in the right hemisphere-was challenged 20 years ago, when the influence of music education on brain lateralization was demonstrated. Modern concepts emphasize the modular organization of music cognition. According to this viewpoint, different aspects of music are processed in different, although partly overlapping neuronal networks of both hemispheres. However, even when isolating a single "module," such as, for example, the perception of contours, the interindividual variance of brain substrates is enormous. To clarify the factors contributing to this variability, we conducted a longitudinal experiment comparing the effects of procedural versus explicit music teaching on brain networks. We demonstrated that cortical activation during music processing reflects the auditory "learning biography," the personal experiences accumulated over time. Listening to music, learning to play an instrument, formal instruction, and professional training result in multiple, in many instances multisensory, representations of music.

AB  - This study investigated young children's music learning processes in a classroom environment through observations based on Csikszentmihalyi's (1975, 1988, 1990, 1997a) model of flow experience, a paradigm based on the individual's perception of high challenge and high skill for a given activity. Participants included a class of eleven 4- and 5-year-old children in the beginning months of parent participative music instruction at a private music school. Since conventional flow studies utilized self-reporting methodology, a measurement tool for recording observed flow in preschoolers was developed: the Flow Indicators in Musical Activities (FIMA) form. Eight 1-hour classes were videotaped and analyzed via event sampling; events were defined musical activities including ear training, keyboard playing, singing, rhythm and skill games, storytelling, and writing. Data revealed a total of 142 observable events coded for between 1 and 11 children, resulting in 472 FIMA entries. Reliability was established in a comparison of percentages of agreement between 2 independent coders. Factor analysis of 9 Affective indicators resulted in 4 discrete dimensions of experience similar to those found in previous flow studies: Affect (happiness + cheerfulness + excited), Potency (alert + involved + active), Self-concept (satisfied + successful) and Comfort. Factor analysis of 8 Behavioral indicators resulted in 3 discrete dimensions specific to this study of young children: Behavior (skill + 3 operationalizations of flow--anticipation, expansion, and extension); Challenge (challenge + adult awareness); and Imitation (imitation + peer awareness). Multiple regression analyses showed Potency, Self-concept, Behavior, and Challenge to significantly predict flow. Using the flow-predicting dimensions as signifiers of flow experience, ANOVA tests were run comparing general characteristics of musical events. Findings showed the most flow to exist in the longest (7 minute) activities, the moderately familiar activities (2-4 weeks), the one-on-one social context, and the individual student keyboard location. Comparisons of experience between specific musical events showed activities characterized by multi-sensory involvement, unambiguous feedback, and perceived opportunities for action facilitated the most flow; these included the Major/minor and Hide-a-note games as well as Keyboard playing. Data also suggested a model for flow-facilitating adult intervention strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Presents a multisensory intervention combining the use of art, music, and movement utilized within a long-term care setting among 70-93 yr old persons, including those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Results show that in spite of extreme cognitive losses, this experience enabled Ss to utilize remaining strengths and call upon alternate pathways to realize their greatest potential and to experience their greatest degree of stimulation and pleasure. The benefits derived by some Ss who regularly attended these sessions are discussed. It is noted that many were able to retrieve memories, enjoy socialization, and have the opportunity for affective expression, which they were no longer able to verbalize. These experiences served to increase a sense of self and preserve the uniqueness of the individuals. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The teaching and learning of music has been the focus of much research in the areas of education, psychology, music education and music psychology. Finding new ways to improve student learning has been taken on as a serious challenge and new designs and technologies have been created by all of these disciplines. Most educational researchers and practitioners would agree that teachers who have multiple means of addressing differences in student learning styles are holding the keys to their pupils' success. Recent educational research has uncovered the value of learning through the use of semiotics and other means that address multiple ways of knowing. Mental Imagery (MI) has proven to be successful as an educational technique by incorporating whatever means possible to enable students to create mental pictures that they may retain. This work includes the use of multisensory learning, is experiential in nature, addresses student emotional growth and aesthetic experience and can be made more effective with cooperative learning technology and student input. Although imagery has been employed in music therapy settings as an elicited response to programmed music, no formal studies have been conducted using MI as an intervening design to improve effectiveness in music education. The purpose of this study has been to look at the use of mental imagery in an elementary school music classroom. Of key focus are the students and the types of images that help them to learn, the facilitative work of the teacher and the relationships between students and teacher. Initial work done in a pilot study showed promise for connecting cognitive and affective learning while improving student accomplishment and interest. In an ongoing, naturalistic study, the use of MI as created by teachers and students to facilitate student learning of music has been recorded, documented and analyzed as educational events have unfolded. Through the use of interviews, document review, on-site observations (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The multistage process of auditory skills include detection to sound, discrimination between sounds, and identification. Helping hearing-impaired children function successfully from sensory/primitive throughout linguistic stages is important for the development of speech perception and production. The Multisensory Sound Lab is educational technology developed for use by groups of children who are deaf or hearing impaired. It provides simultaneous visual, tactile, and auditory information in response to acoustic inputs. The amount and type of multisensory reinforcements can be adjusted by the user. Example applications of the Sound Lab include sound detection, sound comprehension (where the children were instructed to name orally and manually soft and loud sounds), gross vocalization, articulation, and music enrichment.

AB  - Examined the effect of 3 rhythm presentation modalities on the recall of rhythm patterns. 70 1st graders, 70 3rd graders, and 70 5th graders were tested either visually, auditorily, kinesthetically, or with combinations of these modalities. Each child was asked to memorize and clap 6 rhythm patterns of increasing difficulty, which were presented either iconically (visually), by playing a resonator bell (auditorily), by patting the child's hand (kinesthetically), or through combinations of these treatments. Grade level was significant. Test scores from students who were presented rhythm patterns using a multimodal presentation indicate that students were not confused by the multisensory input. The 1st-grade visual test results were significantly lower than results with older children. These findings suggest that the incorporation of learning modalities into music teaching methods could result in more efficient learning of rhythm patterns. Although the visual method of 1st graders was not as effective as other presentations, older children were successful with all combinations of teaching presentations.

AB  - Discusses, from a psychoanalytic viewpoint, the reasons why a combination of music and painting in art therapy with psychotic patients is preferable to either music or painting alone. Psychotic patients are locked in at a psychic level where aesthetic experiences appear interchangeable, unstructured, and without sublimational values. Simultaneous painting and music therapy provides patients with a multisensory immersion, enabling them to use integrative mechanisms and experience libidinal transformation based on sublimational sexuality. The psychotherapist plays a major role in structuring the setting and programming the artistic experiences to successfully accomplish these goals.

AB  - Discusses psychological aspects and messages in the films Jaws and The Mirror. Jaws is a penetrating study of the conflict between the humane, democratic values that people profess and the motive of economic gain that tends to be a more potent determinant of their actions. An important element in both Jaws and The Mirror is the music, which features an insistent rhythmic sound that builds to nearly unbearable tension. A scene in The Mirror portrays a multisensory experience that captures on the screen a preverbal level of development that rarely returns in adulthood except in fever, nightmares, or between sleep and wakefulness. A psychoanalytic interpretation of both films suggests that the fear of the ocean depths in Jaws symbolizes the anxiety-arousing aspects of mother-infant symbiosis, while the vanishing circular blob in The Mirror symbolizes the breast evaporating into nothingness and the subsequent threat of annihilation through abandonment, isolation, and emptiness.
