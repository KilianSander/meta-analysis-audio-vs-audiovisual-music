AB  - We investigated the perception of synchrony for complex audiovisual events. In Experiment 1, a series of music (guitar and piano), speech (sentences), and object action video clips were presented at a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) using the method of constant stimuli. Participants made unspeeded temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding which stream (auditory or visual) appeared to have been presented first. Temporal discrimination accuracy was significantly better for the object actions than for the speech video clips, and both were significantly better than for the music video clips. In order to investigate whether or not these differences in TOJ performance were driven by differences in stimulus familiarity, we conducted a second experiment using brief speech (syllables), music (guitar), and object action video clips of fixed duration together with temporally reversed (i.e., less familiar) versions of the same stimuli. The results showed no main effect of stimulus type on temporal discrimination accuracy. Interestingly, however, reversing the video clips resulted in a significant decrement in temporal discrimination accuracy as compared to the normally presented for the music and object actions clips, but not for the speech stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that cross-modal temporal discrimination performance is better for audiovisual stimuli of lower complexity as compared to stimuli having continuously varying properties (e.g., syllables versus words and/or sentences).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between physical attractiveness and performance ratings of high-level pianists. Eighteen of the 30 competitors who participated in the Eleventh Van Cliburn International Piano Competition were rated by undergraduate and graduate music students and faculty. Participants were divided into three groups who rated the performances under either audio, audiovisual, or visual-only conditions. Visual-only participants rated performers on physical attractiveness, dress, and stage behaviour. Results suggest that high-level pianists are not affected in the same way by the apparent attractiveness bias that has been found in studies of novice and college-level musicians. Performers rated low on behaviour received consistently higher performance scores than high behaviour performers regardless of treatment condition (audio or audiovisual). Performers who rated high on each of the visual components benefited from the audiovisual condition, as compared with the audio-only condition, on note accuracy, but not on five other measures of performance. Interactions between each visual component (attractiveness, dress, and behaviour) and gender of the rater raise questions about gender differences in the perception of attractiveness.

AB  - This study examined children's recall and recognition of ad content contained in the audio and video modalities of television commercials. An experiment was conducted with first and fourth graders who were exposed to a 60-second ad with a story-line format. The ad featured typical aspects of ads targeting youngsters, including animated creatures, role transformations, and loud music, among other production techniques. Results support the supremacy of the audiovisual nature of television in conveying information to children. Age differences between the two groups of children were evident. Suggestions for future research are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the DVD The joy of erotic massage by Jules Black (2005). The Sinclair Intimacy Institute is well established as a producer of quality audiovisual aids in our field for therapist and/or client alike. Mark Schoen is a well-known and respected sexologist who has been involved in producing audiovisual materials in the field of human sexuality for 30 years. There is no doubt about the sensuousness of touch and physical contact. Too many couples dive straight into penetrative sex, bypassing a truly erogenous experience that would have served to augment and heighten the climax of the couple's passion. In lasting almost one hour this DVD teaches couples to stretch it all out, to take time in pleasuring one another and satisfying their skin hunger with principally non-verbal communication. The programme is authored so that it can be watched in continuity or in sections, which in turn deal with detailed massage of feet, hands, face, torso, back, breasts and genitals. It is a high-quality production with photography, lighting, settings, background music and a very descriptive commentary, all being top notch.

AB  - When reading film and television reviews, we are usually told by the critics whether the characters and their actions are believable or not, whether the plot has a logical development, whether it is too simple or too complex, and whether the setting is befitting the story. Occasionally, we learn about the director's skill or lack of it, or the creative or unimaginative camera work. But rarely, if ever, do these critics mention the specifics of lighting, picture composition, the continuity of shots, and the role of sound effects. This is understandable, because such media-aesthetic factors work mostly underground. In fact, one of the criteria for good editing is that it is seamless, and for effective film music, that it remains largely unnoticed by the audience. However, such meta-messages are crucial for the clarification and intensification of the various messages, and for how we finally interpret and feel about a particular television show or film. Even the creators of such media fare are often unaware of the perceptual effect a specific type of lighting or sound effect will produce, at least not until such an effect has been applied. What we obviously need for a more precise analysis and synthesis--production--of video, film, and computer presentations is a system that allows a closer look at the various aesthetic media factors, how they function, and how they interact. Applied media aesthetics is such a system. Specifically, media aesthetics examines five basic aesthetic image elements that provide the aesthetic "materia"--the raw material--of television, film, and computer-generated images: (a) light and color, (b) two-dimensional space, (c) three-dimensional space, (d) time-motion, and (e) sound. A close examination of these elements shows their inherent properties, their basic functions, and their potential use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of varying the amount of participant engagement on alcohol expectancy and drinking outcomes during a social/sexual expectancy challenge based on Darkes and Goldman's (1993, 1998) protocol. This study was also intended to provide a test of the efficacy of administering an alcohol/placebo expectancy challenge outside of a live drinking scenario through video presented as part of a computerized intervention. One hundred fifty-eight male participants across three sites were randomized into a no-intervention control group that received non alcohol-related information in a minimally interactive computerized format, a low-level engagement experimental group that received minimally interactive computerized expectancy-related information, and a high-level engagement experimental group that received the same expectancy-related information presented in a more interactive computerized format that included games and audiovisual elements such as video clips, graphics, live narrations, and music. It was hypothesized that high-level engagement participants would report being more engaged in their computerized program and demonstrate greater decreases in social/sexual alcohol expectancies and drinking levels relative to control and low-level engagement participants. Results indicated that while high-level engagement participants reported being more engaged in their interventions, none of the groups exhibited changes in the alcohol expectancies measured. In addition, all three groups experienced significant but comparable decreases in drinking levels. Exploratory follow-up analyses were also conducted to provide suggestions for future directions.

AB  - Digital culture is becoming increasingly global and accessible. It is important to see how participation in the European Union (EU) global economic culture is changing young people's self-images. Representations of heroic figures in questionnaires given to Irish (n = 239) and Slovenian (n = 389) samples of 15-year-olds were examined to assess the extent to which heroes originated in film and television, and whether the heroic figures were local or global personalities. The degree to which age and gender influence choice of hero was examined within the Irish sample, which also included 10-year-olds (n = 316). There is strong evidence that heroes in this sample were largely learned about on film and television, since family or community heroes were a minority (Ireland 23%, Slovenia 17%). Children chose male heroes more often than female heroes, though a child's sex was associated with sex of hero chosen. Family, sport and musical heroes were more important in Ireland than Slovenia, and audio-visual heroes were more important in Slovenia. In the digital age the sequence for acquisition of hero type reported in the pre-television era -- proximal (family and community) to distal (beyond the neighbourhood) -- seems to have disappeared.

AB  - We examined whether monitoring asynchronous audiovisual speech induces a general temporal recalibration of auditory and visual sensory processing. Participants monitored a videotape featuring a speaker pronouncing a list of words (Experiments 1 and 3) or a hand playing a musical pattern on a piano (Experiment 2). The auditory and visual channels were either presented in synchrony, or else asynchronously (with the visual signal leading the auditory signal by 300 ms; Experiments 1 and 2). While performing the monitoring task, participants were asked to judge the temporal order of pairs of auditory (white noise bursts) and visual stimuli (flashes) that were presented at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) during the session. The results showed that, while monitoring desynchronized speech or music, participants required a longer interval between the auditory and visual stimuli in order to perceive their temporal order correctly, suggesting a widening of the temporal window for audiovisual integration. The fact that no such recalibration occurred when we used a longer asynchrony (1000 ms) that exceeded the temporal window for audiovisual integration (Experiment 3) supports this conclusion.

AB  - Art forms (music, painting, sculpture, literature and theatre) are essential components in all social and human contexts. The role of art, in this case of theatre, is to express a visual event that aims to help the spectator identify himself/herself in the characters. The play presented here is "A...come non so" and shows the characteristic aspects of Alzheimer's disease from the first stage of the disease to the last stage: amnesia, aphasia, agnosia and apraxia. It tells the story of Carlo Pontercoli, a gerontologist and specialist in cardiovascular disease, who, while writing his paper on "The elderly and sexuality", manifests the first signs of the disease that killed his mother not so long before. The monologue aims to be a new contribution to the whole understanding of the problems concerning Alzheimer's disease through observation and visual communication of those problems.

AB  - Audiovisual perception and imitation are essential for musical learning and skill acquisition. We compared professional pianists to musically naive controls with fMRI while observing piano playing finger-hand movements and serial finger-thumb opposition movements both with and without synchronous piano sound. Pianists showed stronger activations within a fronto-parieto-temporal network while observing piano playing compared to controls and contrasted to perception of serial finger-thumb opposition movements. Observation of silent piano playing additionally recruited auditory areas in pianists. Perception of piano sounds coupled with serial finger-thumb opposition movements evoked increased activation within the sensorimotor network. This indicates specialization of multimodal auditory-sensorimotor systems within a fronto-parieto-temporal network by professional musical training. Musical "language," which is acquired by observation and imitation, seems to be tightly coupled to this network in accord with an observation-execution system linking visual and auditory perception to motor performance.

AB  - As noted by Winn (1993), "Human speech is the most powerful and expressive medium the designer has available for use in instructional messages" (p. 117). Speech is naturally expressive, and by varying the qualities of loudness, pitch, pace, and tone, designers can use audio to motivate and inform students. Three primary audio elements are used in educational technology-- music, speech, and sound effects. Through these elements, audio can deliver information, direct attention, convey emotions, and provide feedback. Although audio in an important instructional tool, it has not been studied as much as other media. This chapter focuses on published research studies related to audio. Beginning with evaluation research and media comparison studies, the focus is then shifted to auditory memory and multichannel communication. A multimedia section focuses on design guidelines for incorporating audio in multimedia instruction. Finally, an overview of time-compressed speech and a summary are provided.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether judgments of solo performances recorded at a well-known international piano competition would be affected by musical characteristics such as style (classic period versus early 20th-century Russian) and tempo (slow versus fast). Evaluators rated performances on six test items: tone quality, note accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, expressiveness, adherence to style and overall impression. The effects of four between-subjects variables were examined: audio versus audiovisual presentation, undergraduate versus graduate/faculty, gender, and pianists versus non-pianists. Results from the 227 evaluators revealed main effects for treatment, style and major: audiovisual presentations were rated higher than audio only presentations, performances of Russian music were rated higher than performances of classic music, and pianists rated performances higher than did non-pianists. The treatment effect was due to a significant treatment by major interaction, and applied only to non-pianists. Gender was involved in a number of three- and four-way interactions that are difficult to interpret. Pearson r correlations were calculated for ratings of the 16 performances on the overall impression test item. The mean correlation for the 120 pairs of ratings was .33--low but statistically significant. Intraclass correlations revealed no significant differences between the two levels of all four between-subjects variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Infants who were 6 months of age were presented with extended audiovisual episodes of their mother's infant-directed speech or singing. Cumulative visual fixation and initial fixation of the mother's image were longer for maternal singing than for maternal speech. Moreover, movement reduction, which may signal intense engagement, accompanied visual fixation more frequently for maternal singing than for maternal speech. The stereotypy and repetitiveness of maternal singing may promote moderate arousal levels, which sustain infant attention, in contrast to the greater variability of speech, which may result in cycles of heightened arousal, gaze aversion, and re-engagement. The regular pulse of music may also enhance emotional coordination between mother and infant. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine whether there were significant differences in male or female middle-school students' ability to appropriately convey the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear while singing musical passages within the context of four treatment situations. Four treatment methodologies were designed to identify whether (a) participants can be taught to sing with emotional expressiveness, and (b) a specific treatment method would be significantly better for this task. The treatments used four different learning conditions: traditional instruction, aural modeling, kinesthetic exploration, and audio-visual learning. Each treatment enabled participants to explore different approaches to performing music with emotion. A significant interaction effect was found between males and females in their rated ability to convey anger in their voices, with females scoring significantly lower than males. Happiness and sadness were conveyed equally well by males and females, and fear was difficult for both to convey. There was a statistically significant difference found in effectiveness of the four treatment methodologies, showing modeling (treatment II) and audio-visual (treatment IV) methodologies to be significantly better than verbal instruction (treatment I). Implications for music education and directions for future research were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The use of video evidence as a vehicle for promoting discussion and critical reflection is well established in educational literature in the field of professional development and is gradually becoming more accepted as a research method. There is general agreement also that in relation to image-based research the combination of video evidence of practice and professional dialogue promote critical reflection and can be instrumental in bringing about changes to that practice. Our aim in this paper is firstly to explore briefly our use of video images as a catalyst for promoting rich dialogue that supports multiple perspectives, meanings and interpretations of classroom events. We describe from a very practical perspective the trials and tribulations of developing a methodology for collecting and analyzing video recordings of classroom practice. Secondly, we describe our attempts to capture and narrate the experience as a multimodal account (Kress & Leeuwen, 2001) for dissemination purposes. The experience of coming to understand and work with the possibilities and constraints offered by the integration of media such as graphic/video image, text, music and becoming familiar with the language of 'roll-overs', 'one-stop-shops', 'rendering' was for us a very steep learning curve which proved both exciting and challenging.

AB  - Lip reading is known to activate the planum temporale (PT), a brain region which may integrate visual and auditory information. To find out whether other types of learned audio-visual integration occur in the PT, we investigated "key-touch reading" using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As well-trained pianists are able to identify pieces of music by watching the key-touching movements of the hands, we hypothesised that the visual information of observed sequential finger movements is transformed into the auditory modality during "key-touch reading" as is the case during lip reading. We therefore predicted activation of the PT during key-touch reading. Twenty-six healthy right-handed volunteers were recruited for fMRI. Of these, 7 subjects had never experienced piano training (naive group), 10 had a little experience of piano playing (less trained group), and the remaining 9 had been trained for more than 8 years (well trained group). During task periods, subjects were required to view the bimanual hand movements of a piano player making key presses. During control periods, subjects viewed the same hands sliding from side to side without tapping movements of the fingers. No sound was provided. Sequences of key presses during task periods consisted of pieces of familiar music, unfamiliar music, or random sequences. Well-trained subjects were able to identify the familiar music, whereas less-trained subjects were not. The left PT of the well-trained subjects was equally activated by observation of familiar music, unfamiliar music, and random sequences. The naive and less trained groups did not show activation of the left PT during any of the tasks. These results suggest that PT activation reflects a learned process. As the activation was elicited by viewing key pressing actions regardless of whether they constituted a piece of music, the PT may be involved in processes that occur prior to the identification of a piece of music, that is, mapping the complex sequence structure of hand movements onto the sequence of sounds.

AB  - We investigated how the attractiveness bias that influences the judgment of a variety of characteristics and behaviors in infants, children, and adults affects the evaluation of young pianists' performances. The assumption was that both the visual and the audio components of a videotaped musical performance influence the viewer's perception of performance quality. We asked children, musicians, and nonmusicians (n = 75) to rate the quality of 10 piano performances from audiotapes (sound only) and from videotapes (sound and image). Additionally, the participants rated the attractiveness of the performers from brief videos of the performers getting ready to play. Results show that evaluations of audiovisual recordings of musical performances are judged more reliably than are audio recordings but also suggest that they may be affected by an attractiveness bias. The bias was found to favor the more attractive pianists among the female performers and among the best players, and the less attractive pianists among the male performers. The decision to use more reliable means of evaluation (videotapes or DVDs) at the expense of favoring a particular group of performers would have to be taken carefully depending on the outcomes of the situation.

AB  - To encourage students to experience key themes and principles of child development in a popular medium, we played musical selections ranging from contemporary rock to children's pieces before each session of a child development class. Simultaneously, visual projection of the lyrics along with text and pictures highlighted the relevance of the music to that day's discussion. Students indicated the audio-visual presentations were interesting and pertinent and should continue in future offerings of the course. The activity provides students with opportunities to become aware of themes and principles of development from a socially and culturally significant resource not routinely considered by instructors.

AB  - We examined the personality-related differences in people's emotional and other responses to news messages with a slow vs. a fast speech rate and a rising vs. a falling background music melody. Personality was measured with the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS)/Behavioural Activation System (BAS) scales and the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire. Physiological parameters studied were electrodermal activity (EDA), pulse transit time, and interbeat intervals. Several findings consistent with the similarity-attraction theory emerged. For example, subjects scoring high on the BAS, Activity, and Aggression-Hostility dimensions reacted more positively to the news with a fast compared to a slow speech rate. The rising-melody news also elicited higher EDA than the falling-melody news among high BAS scorers. The results suggest that users may be attracted to media messages with audio characteristics manifesting emotions or a personality similar to their own.

AB  - The documentation of music therapy situations by means of sound and/or video recording is an important tool for the music therapist. The investigation presented here examines whether a purely medial (audio)visual communication can reveal the emotional content of a situation, and in what way this depends on the various media forms used. In an empirical investigation, specially prepared vocal improvisations on different basic emotions were presented to a total of 36 test persons as purely video or audio recordings, or as complete image-and-sound recordings. The test persons were asked to assess the improvised emotion. The findings show a considerable influence of the media form both on quality of assessment and confidence of assessment, with clear differentiation among the various basic emotions.

AB  - Using cognitive load theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning as a framework, we conducted two within-subject experiments with 10 participants each in order to investigate (1) if the audiovisual presentation of verbal and pictorial learning materials would lead to a higher demand on phonological cognitive capacities than the visual-only presentation of the same material, and (2) if adding seductive background music to an audiovisual information presentation would increase the phonological cognitive load. We employed the dual-task methodology in order to achieve a direct measurement of cognitive load in the phonological system. In both experiments, the modality effect could be confirmed in the patterns of secondary task performance and in the primary learning task.

AB  - We examined the emotional effects of (a) a rising versus a falling chromatic tone sequence in the background of audio news and (b) foreground versus background diatonic and chromatic tone sequences. In experiment one, 26 participants rated audio news messages with rising and falling chromatic background tone sequences on the valence and arousal dimensions. Cardiac activity, electrodermal activity (EDA), and facial muscle activity were also recorded continuously. In experiment two, 24 participants rated six plain tone sequences (i.e., rising and falling chromatic, major, and minor) and six news messages with the aforementioned tone sequences mixed in the background on the valence and arousal dimensions. In experiment 1, both self-reported arousal and physiological arousal as measured by EDA were higher during the news with a rising-tone sequence compared to those with a falling-tone sequence. In experiment 2, rising-tone sequences prompted both higher arousal and pleasantness ratings. However, the responses were moderated by the type of listening task: foreground listening prompted responses related to musical connotations (i.e., major tone sequences were rated as most pleasant and minor as most unpleasant), whereas background listening prompted responses dependent on the emotional congruence between the news messages and tone sequences (i.e., the minor mode versions were rated as most pleasant and the major mode versions as most unpleasant). In addition, level of education-, music listening frequency-, and age-related differences in the responses were found and are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Pockemon shock is a well-know incident in the history of the Japanese broadcasting industry. In this study, we evaluated electrocardiography (ECG), arterial blood pressure (BP). Eight healthy adult volunteers participated in this experiment with satisfactory informed consent. ECG and BP were recorded for each subject during three different protocols: resting condition (RS), healing video contents shown on a screen (HS), and a mosaic picture shown with inverted music on a screen (IS). All tests were done while subjects were sitting. Time length of the software was about 15 minutes. All data were recorded in a digital data recorder. Fast fourier transform (FFT), and nonlinear mathematical analyzing methodologies including chaos and fractal theory were utilized to evaluate the fluctuations in the hemodynamic parameters. Spectral analysis was performed to evaluate the heart rate variability (HRV) and BP variability during the experiment, however, there were no significant changes during because of wide standard deviation. Fractal dimension of HRV was significantly lower in HS (1.61+/-0.09), but significantly higher in IS (1.53+/-0.07) than in RS (1.57+/-0.04, p<0.05). We must continue our study aiming at safe audiovisual stimulating equipment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Music video (MV) content is frequently measured using researcher descriptions. This study examines subjective or viewers' notions of sex and violence. 168 university students watched 9 mainstream MVs. Incidence counts of sex and violence involve more mediating factors than ratings. High incidents are associated with older viewers, higher scores for Expressivity, lower scores for Instrumentality, and with video orders beginning with high sex and violence. Ratings of sex and violence are associated with older viewers and lower scores for Instrumentality. For sex MVs, inexperienced viewers reported higher incidents and ratings. Because MVs tend to be sexier but less violent than TV and film, viewers may also use comparative media standards to evaluate emotional content MVs.

AB  - Discusses how the cultural circuit model can be used to compare the study of P. du Gay et al study (1997) of the Sony Walkman with the case of Napster, and how Napster accommodates the use of this model. Media studies scholars have employed the cultural circuit model to analyze media in the context of a capitalist political economy. This model identifies interrelated moments in which the meanings of cultural products are determined, negotiated, and subverted in interaction between producers and audiences. The turbulent evolution of new media, however, requires continuous reflection on the adequacy of conceptual tools. In a case study of the Sony Walkman, du Gay et al argued that it was the site of intensive interaction where forms and practices associated with particular spheres folded into each other. In the 1990s, the development of codec software allowed personal computer users to rip recorded music from compact disks and convert the music to digitized files that could be exchanged over the Internet. During 1999, 2 young entrepreneurs developed the Napster software system, allowing free, direct, peer-to-peer exchange of these files. Analysis of recent controversy surrounding Napster indicates that the cultural circuit model must be modified. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We report on the difficulties in prosodic speech perception encountered by a patient (KB) after a right hemisphereic stroke. In addition to musical deficits, KB was suspected of having impaired auditory prosody perception. As expected, KB was impaired on 2 prosody perception tasks in an auditory-only condition. We also examined whether the addition of visual prosody cues would facilitate his performance on these tasks. Unexpectedly, KB was also impaired on both tasks under visual-only and audio-visual conditions. Thus, there was no evidence that KB could integrate auditory and visual prosody information or that he could use visual cues to compensate for his deficit in the auditory domain. In contrast, KB was able to identify segmental speech information using visual cues and to use these visual cues to improve his performance when auditory segmental cues were impoverished. KB was also able to integrate audio-visual segmental information in the McGurk effect. Thus, KB's visual deficit was specific to prosodic speech perception and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such a deficit.

AB  - The infant's environment is filled with musical input. Mothers' speech to infants is music-like, exhibiting a variety of musical features that reflect its emotional expressiveness. Although this speech has similar melodic contours across cultures, which reflect comparable expressive intentions, each mother has individually distinctive interval patterns or speech tunes. Mothers also sing to infants in an emotive manner, their repeated performances being unusually stable in pitch and tempo. Infants prefer affectively positive speech to affectively neutral speech, and they prefer infant-directed performances of songs to other performances. When infants are presented with audio-visual versions of their mother's speech and singing, they exhibit more sustained interest in the singing than in the speech episodes. Finally, live maternal singing has more sustained effects on infant arousal than does live maternal speech. This article discusses the implications of these findings and suggests directions for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews research regarding the question of whether presenting music live, audio-visually or only aurally makes any difference for listeners' experiences. Most factors that characterize live performance could be supposed to enhance listeners' cognitive, affective and evaluative experiences. However, it is often hard to predict the exact influence of the visual stimuli that relate to audio-visual, and mostly also to live musical presentation. Many studies show that live music has positive effects on listeners' experience. However, there is little systematic research that compares live music with other modes of presentation. Studies comparing the effects of audio-visual and aural presentation have yielded rather mixed results. There is a need for well-controlled studies on the effects of live music and on audio-visual music presentation based mainly on musico-psychological rather than visual-artistic principles. The research needs to take account of the variables that are crucial for understanding the effects of different modes of presentation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 2 experiments, children's (2nd graders) and young adults' (college students) memory of content presented via educational televised songs from School House Rock was examined. Single exposures favored verbal over sung presentations for recognition of important verbal content. After repeated exposure to a second vignette, children and adults remembered more educational material verbatim, and boys were better able to sequence important visual material, but participants still did not recognize significant verbal program content. The results suggest that songs improve verbatim memory, but spoken presentations improve verbal comprehension of content. Policy implications concerning the educational and informational requirements of the Children's Television Act are considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Everyday we encounter sights and sounds paired together. This experiment investigates one type of audiovisual integration: that of biological motion and musical phrases. The current proposal hypothesizes that brief musical phrases can influence the implied action motion of a static human form stick figure and body action terms through different melodies and rhythms. The results are discussed in terms of Lipscomb and Kendall's (1994) model of audiovisual perception, Mayer and Sims' (1994) dual coding of multimedia learning, as well as understanding the mechanisms for when and how we process and interpret the integration of music and simple pictorial representations. A proposal of audiovisual Gestalt principles is discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Vasovagal reactions experienced by some blood donors have been shown to be related to a decreased likelihood of future blood donations. The efficacy of audiovisual distraction as a means of reducing self-reported physiological reactions in 1st-time blood donors was evaulated. Individual coping style was assessed as a possible moderating variable. 112 1st-time blood donors (mean age 19 yrs) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: audiovisual distraction or no-treatment control. Ss in the distraction group donated blood at an American Red Cross (ARC) blood drive while watching a 3-dimensional video. The control group donated blood according to standard ARC procedures. Score on a self-reported measure of physiological reactions completed immediately after donation served as the dependent variables. Ss who typically use blunting coping strategies to cope with stress reported an attenuation of vasovagal reactions to blood donation in the distraction vs. the control condition, whereas donors who prefer a monitoring coping style did not benefit from distraction. Among 1st-time blood donors, audiovisual distraction may be an effective means of reducing vasovagal reactions in donors who prefer to cope with stress using such strategies as distraction, denial, and reinterpretation.

AB  - Emotions should play an important role in the design of interfaces because people interact with machines as if they were social actors. This paper presents a literature review on affective expressions through speech, music and body language. It summarizes the quality and quantity of their parameters and successful examples of synthesis. Moreover, a model for the convincingness of affective expressions, based on B. J. Fogg and Hsiang Tseng (1999), was developed and tested. The empirical data did not support the original model and therefore this paper proposes a new model, which is based on appropriateness and intensity of the expressions. Furthermore, the experiment investigated if the type of emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear and disgust), knowledge about the source (human or machine), the level of abstraction (natural face, computer rendered face and matrix face) and medium of presentation (visual, audio/visual, audio) of an affective expression influences its convincingness and distinctness. 20 male and 13 female Ss (aged 21-61 yrs) participated in the experiment. Only the type of emotion and multimedia presentations had an effect on convincingness. The distinctness of an expression depends on the abstraction and the media through which it is presented.

AB  - Investigated the use of music to frame perceptions in teaser advertisements that rely heavily on nonverbal executional cues to communicate. In Exp 1, 102 undergraduate students (aged 18-22 yrs) viewed a visual track (VT) advertising an upscale shopping mall, then viewed it again with either a Baroque concerto as slow music (VTS) or a rock song as faster music (VTF). Ss completed questionnaires concerning emotional and image responses. Results show that the VT itself was successful, spirited, and daring. The VTS was more successful, imaginative, and calm than the VTF. The VTF was more daring, annoying, and boring. In Exp 2, 26 female Ss participated in focus groups concerning the same presented advertisement. Results show that the advertisement with the VTS was assessed as having an upscale position appealing to the upper market and leisure class, with very high prices. The VTF was assessed as having a young and active image appealing to the young professionals. It is concluded that interactive audiovisual images play an important role in the meaning enactment process. Specifically, music connects with and accentuates selective visual events, as well as selective aspects of a visual event, to draw out the advertising proposition.

AB  - Examined whether selected nonmusical attributes of 6th-grade pianists would affect ratings of their performances. Twenty pianists were videotaped. They and their performances were rated by 123 musically trained evaluators. Members of the visual group viewed a videotape with the sound turned off. They rated pianists on appropriateness of dress, stage behavior and physical attractiveness. These ratings were the basis for grouping students as being high or low on each of these 3 attributes. Audiovisual and audio group members rated musical performance on 5 test items. Results reveal support for the existence of a bias: although high pianists were rated higher than low pianists under the audio condition for all 3 attributes, the differences between them often were significantly greater under the audiovisual condition than under the audio-only condition. In addition, videotaped performances were not rated higher than audiotaped performances. Also, female judges were more lenient than male judges.

AB  - Current literature regarding music video television reports that adolescents watch music video simply to be entertained. The limited focus of the literature on stereotypes, deviant behaviors, and negative images in videos must be balanced by empirical investigations that examine the cognitive processes that occur when adolescents watch music videos. Although entertainment may clearly be hypothesized as one possible layer of why adolescents watch music videos, mass communication theory, adolescent developmental theory, and ecological systems theory clearly provide additional, developmentally plausible explanations. This study examined the medium of music video and the adolescent in the context of the relevant social processes and the salient psychological task of adolescent development-identity formation. The study extended the literature by quantitatively assessing three potential domains of adolescent music video processing: social competence, negative identity, and entertainment only. The hypothesis was that adolescents who watched music videos were more likely to recognize and relate to the socially competent behaviors demonstrated in the music videos than to the negative images or entertainment only value of the videos. The study also investigated the utility of a new measure for assessing adolescent processing of music video, called the Music Video Influence Measure (M-VIM). An ethnically-diverse sample of 495 high school students from three public school systems participated in this study. Additional information about adolescent social competence was gathered from both the adolescents and their teachers using the Social Skills Rating System, and compared with information derived from the M-VIM. Results from both student and teacher data supported the construct and concurrent validity of the M-VIM. Specifically, factor analysis yielded a two-factor solution, Proactive Social Schema and Reactive Social Schema. Canonical analyses revealed significant relationships between these M-VIM factors and both teacher and student assessments of social competence on the social skills subscales of the SSRS. Lastly, examination of age and gender differences revealed that male students and ninth grade students received significantly higher scores for Reactive Social Schema (factor two of the M-VIM). In contrast, females and twelfth grade students scored significantly higher on Proactive Social Schema (factor 1 of the M-VIM). Implications for adolescent developmental theory and future research were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors tested the recommendation that adding bells and whistles (in the form of background music and/or sounds) would improve the quality of a multimedia instructional message. In 2 studies, students received an animation and concurrent narration intended to explain the formation of lightning (Experiment 1) or the operation of hydraulic braking systems (Experiment 2). For some students, the authors added background music (Group NM), sounds (Group NS), both (Group NSM), or neither (Group N). On tests of retention and transfer, Group NSM performed worse than Group N; groups receiving music performed worse than groups not receiving music; and groups receiving sounds performed worse (only in Experiment 2) than groups not receiving sounds. Results were consistent with the idea that auditory adjuncts can overload the learner's auditory working memory, as predicted by a cognitive theory of multimedia learning.

AB  - Seven focus groups were conducted with first-year college students to better understand how viewers "read" religious imagery within secular videos. During 3 sessions, participants completed a short questionnaire about their media habits and then watched 2 music videos ("Zombies" by the Cranberries and "Murder Was the Case" by Snoop Doggy Dogg) without the audio. The exploratory study revealed that while the students recalled the images and identified them using traditional terms, their interpretations of the symbols often went beyond a limited overt reading. For many respondents, the lyrics did not enhance-and in some cases detracted-from the understanding of the video gained through viewing the visual images.

AB  - Findings suggest that more-attractive performers may progress to a higher level in their acquisition of performance skills than less-attractive performers. In this study, videotaped violin performances were rated by 3 groups consisting of 72 graduate students and university faculty members. The visual group rated violinists on appropriateness of dress, stage behavior, and physical attractiveness while viewing the tape with no sound. Members of the audiovisual and audio groups rated musical performance on only musical attributes. Results from the audiovisual and audio groups revealed significant interactions between ratings of dress and stage behavior: violinists who were high on stage behavior and on dress benefited significantly from videotaped evaluation, but violinists who were low on these attributes were not evaluated differently on audiotape vs videotape. For attractiveness, there was no significant interaction: more attractive violinists received higher musical performance ratings than less attractive violinists did under both the audiovisual and audio conditions.

AB  - This study compared the ratings assigned to audio and videotaped vibrato performances of inexperienced and experienced violinists and violists. 33 inexperienced and 28 experienced players were videotaped while performing vibrato. A panel of experts rated the videotaped performances and then 6 mo later rated the audio-only portion of the performances on 5 vibrato factors: width, speed, evenness, pitch stability, and overall sound. Experienced players' vibrato was rated higher for all factors, regardless of mode of presentation. In addition, results revealed significantly higher audiovisual ratings for pitch stability, evenness, and overall sound for inexperienced players, and for pitch stability for experienced players. Results suggest that string teachers need to occasionally listen to their students' vibrato without watching them since visual cues may inadvertently influence their evaluation of student achievement.

AB  - This study developed a "cultural-structural model of media use," which depicts the relationships among the cultural and structural factors, satisfaction-seeking motivations, media content preferences, engagement style, performative aspects, occasions of use, satisfaction obtained, and unintended consequences. In this model, it is assumed that individuals (a) actively participate in the process of media use not simply react to the media, (b) are moderated in that action by cultural definitions, (c) are directed by structural components in which actual engagement occurs, and (d) have the capacity to report what they do with media. The model is tested through a survey of about 500 adolescents on their music video use activities, by employing the structural equational modelling (SEM) or linear structural relations analysis (LISREL). Test results empirically support the propositions of this study. (a) Cultural values have a strong influence on almost all stages of the individual's media use. It affects directly and indirectly the individual' s media expectation or satisfaction sought, content preference, performative aspects, occasions of use, satisfaction obtained and unintended consequences. (b) Structural factors such as media environment influence directly the individual's engagement style that is the measure of how and whom the individual uses television with. Media environment also affects indirectly the individual's occasions of use through engagement style. (c) The individual's performative aspects have an influence on the level of satisfaction obtained. This finding indicates that the television viewer's active interpretation of the media contents results in the different level of satisfaction obtained. The more active, the more satisfied. (d) The first order reliabilities and structural consistencies demonstrate the respondents ability to report, in complex terms, their media use.

AB  - Determined whether physical attractiveness of singers would affect judges' ratings of their vocal performances. 14 singers (6 female, 8 male) were videotaped. They and their performances were rated by 82 musicians, who were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The visual group rated singers on physical attractiveness only. The audiovisual group Ss rated musical performance from the videotape. Ss in the audio group rated musical performance from an audiotape dubbed from the videotape. On the basis of visual group ratings, male and female singers were each divided into more-attractive and less-attractive groups. For male singers only, there was no difference in performance ratings between more-attractive and less-attractive singers when rated by audiotape; but audiovisual ratings significantly favored the more attractive singers over the less attractive singers. Other results showed that, for both male and female singers, male raters were more severe than were female raters; that audiovisual ratings were higher than were audio-alone ratings; and that ratings of undergraduate majors versus graduate students and faculty members combined were not differently affected by singers' attractiveness.

AB  - The aim of this book is to introduce the reader to 2 strands of contemporary turn to culture in social science research-the substantive and the epistemological-and to do so through the medium of a particular case-study: that of the Sony Walkman. Through the Walkman example the authors hope to show not only how and why cultural practices and institutions have come to play such a crucial role in our lives in the present, but also to introduce some of the central ideas, concepts and methods of analysis involved in doing a 'cultural study.' (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

      The authors identify 5 major cultural processes-representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation-which together constitute a sort of 'cultural circuit' that can be used to structure the study of any cultural text or artifact. It is this cultural circuit which is used here to analyze the Walkman as a cultural object. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This investigation examined the relationship between musical sound and visual images in the motion picture experience. Most research in this area has dealt with associational aspects of the music and its affect on perception of still pictures or "characters" within film sequences. In contrast, the present study focused specifically on the relationship of points perceived as accented musically and visually. The following research questions were answered: (1) What are the determinants of "accent" (i.e. salient moments) in the visual and auditory fields? and (2) Is the precise alignment of auditory and visual strata necessary to ensure that an observer finds the combination effective? Three experiments were conducted using two convergent methods: a verbal attribute magnitude estimation (VAME) task and a similarity judgment task. Audio-visual (AV) stimuli increased in complexity with each experiment. Three alignment conditions were possible between the musical sound and visual images: consonant (accents in the music occur at the same temporal rate and are perfectly aligned with accents in the visual image), out-of-phase (accents occur at the same rate, but are perceptibly misaligned), or dissonant (accents occur at different rates). Results confirmed that VAME ratings are significantly different to the three alignment conditions. Consonant combinations were rated highest, followed by out-of-phase combinations, and dissonant combinations received the lowest ratings. However, as AV stimuli became more complex (Experiment Three), consonant composites were rated less synchronized and dissonant combinations were rated more synchronized than the simple AV composites in Experiment One. Effectiveness ratings failed to distinguish between consonant and out-of-phase conditions when considering actual movie excerpts. An analysis of variance over the VAME data from all three experiments, revealed that this difference between subject responses to simple animations and responses to c (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored the frequency with which students used background media in self-instructional home study settings, and the perceived effects of students' use of background media on their homework performance. 1,700 students in grade 8 and 10 in the Netherlands completed a questionnaire dealing with various aspects of homework and background media. Results show that the frequency with which students combined homework and media depended on the type of schoolwork (learning vs paper-and-pencil assignments), type of background medium (audio or TV) and the students' level of secondary education. Students felt that their performance on learning assignments was impaired by the use of background media. Their performance on paper-and-pencil assignments was somewhat increased by the use of background audio media and music TV. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the effectiveness of highlight peak performance music videotapes on competitive offensive field goal percentage using 5 male intercollegiate basketball players. Videotapes incorporating each S's best and most effective plays were supplemented by inspirational music and were viewed by the Ss throughout the competitive season. Treatment effects were determined by a single-S multiple-baseline-across-Ss design. Although a causal relationship between highlight videotapes and offensive field goal percentage was not established, the results did demonstrate a mean increase of 4.7% in overall field goal percentage for 3 of the 5 Ss. Social validity was explored through the use of imagery evaluation sheets, individual player logs of introspective thought, and personal interviews.

AB  - Determined the influence of audio (cassette tapes) and audiovisual (music videotapes) reinforcers on motorized bicycle ergometer time-on-task performance of 9 adolescents (aged 13-17 yrs) who were profoundly mentally retarded (PMR). Ss that received audio and audiovisual reinforcers had significantly higher time-on-task performance compared to Ss who received no reinforcement. However, there was no significant difference between audio and audiovisual reinforcers. It was concluded that music and videotapes with music can be effectively used to improve the performance of PMR adolescents when riding a stationary motorized bicycle ergometer.

Highly similar and meaningful perceptual structures were demonstrated for both auditory and visual modalities, showing that important data characteristics (function slope, shape, and level) were perceptually salient in either presentation mode. Results suggest that auditory graphics may be a highly useful alternative to traditional visual graphics for a variety of data presentation applications.

AB  - Investigated the effects of cognitive distortions concerning women on sexually aggressive behavior. 54 male college students listened either to misogynous or to neutral rap music. Ss then viewed neutral, sexual-violent, and assaultive film vignettes and chose 1 to show to a female confederate. Among Ss in the misogynous music condition, 30% showed the assaultive vignette and 70% showed the neutral vignette. In the neutral music condition, 7% showed the sexual-violent or assaultive vignette and 93% showed the neutral vignette. Although confederates did not react, Ss who showed the sexual-violent or assaultive stimuli perceived that the confederate was more upset and uncomfortable viewing these stimuli than did Ss who showed the neutral vignette. Findings suggest that misogynous music facilitates sexually aggressive behavior and support the relationship between cognitive distortions and sexual aggression.

AB  - Several aesthetical, psychoacoustical, and cultural factors discussed in this work imply a musical unity of the aural and the visual senses; this unity is defined as the Visonual. We live in an audiovisual world in which music and other arts have coexisted in societies from North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Some European forms of Arts-integration such as Gesantkunstwerk, Dada, and Happenings, including also Stockhausen's notions of motion and music in space, Ligeti's micropolyphony as well as the musical techniques of Penderecki, Xenakis and Varese, rely on the visonual. For the last forty years, audiovisual influences in music have increased rapidly through electronic technology. This work demonstrates with experiments on instrumental, electronic, and music theatre the Visonual metaphorical construction: music can be heard through the eyes and seen through the ears. According to Foucault's collateral, correlative, and complementary spaces (1969) and in Deleuzian and Guattarian (1980) terms as well as in Emily Hicks' model of holography (1991) the visonual metaphor results from the deterritorialization of the aural and visual senses. Content-discrimination (Dennett: 1991) and prosthetic vision (Bach-y-Rita: 1972) correlate the visonual with forms of narrative stream continually edited by processes distributed around in the brain explaining tactile-visual, visual-olfactory, and aural-visual relationships. Experiments (Marin: 1992) identify energy shape as the common element determining aural visual associations (AVA). Davies' concepts (1978) of "Physiognomic Perception," "High-energy States," "Inner Hearing," "Chunking," and "Synaesthesia" are used to explain AVA. Horning's model of "sensory imaging network" (1982) demonstrated that exchanges of information could occur between visual and aural areas through neural paths. This work also demonstrates that the continuity of meaning through different levels of communication in non programmatic mu (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored the effect of sound on the impression of video and the effect of video on the impression of sound. Two groups of 20 audiovisual excerpts, one each with matched or mismatched audio and visual contents, were used. In Exp 1, 9 Japanese acoustics design students rated audio and visual meaning on 22 scales in unimodal and bimodal contexts and the degree of matching of the audio and visual materials. For the higher-level factors of cleanness and uniqueness, audio meaning had a direct influence on visual meaning for matched excerpts. Consonance, where each modality psychologically affects the other in the same way, depends on the degree of matching for higher-order factors. In Exp 2, audio materials with and without degraded sound quality were rated unimodally and bimodally by 7 male Japanese acoustics design students. Results show that video presentation compensates for the negative effects of audio degradation independent of matching. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the relationship between music and moving images using a semantic differential technique to measure Ss' ratings of audiovisual combinations. Computer generated moving images and specially composed music was used to investigate the interaction of different visual and musical parameters. 27 Ss were divided into 3 groups and either watched or listened to audiovisual, visual, or auditory samples and completed 12 bipolar scales. Results show that the effects of music on the rating of the visual images are essentially additive, and that no interactions between specific musical styles and particular visual images take place. This failure of specific audiovisual combinations to acquire particular semantic characteristics may be attributed to the simplicity of the visual images in the experiment. An approach to the interpretation of audiovisual combinations based on principles of ecological social perception is proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the relationship between the musical soundtrack and visual images in motion pictures. Five scenes and their composer-intended musical scores were selected from a commercial motion picture. Each soundtrack was paired with each visual excerpt, resulting in a total of 25 audiovisual composites. In Exp 1, 16 Ss selected the composite in which the pairing was considered the "best fit." The composer-intended musical score was identified as the best fit by the majority of Ss for all conditions. In Exp 2, 15 Ss rated all 25 composites on semantic differential scales. The composer-intended combination yielded higher mean scores in response to the 4 adjective pairs of the Evaluative dimension. Music exercises a strong and consistent influence over the Ss responses to an audiovisual composite, regardless of visual stimulus. Proposed model formulations for music communication in the context of the motion picture experience are included. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the listener-viewer's use of semantic and formal audiovisual information. Ss were presented with 32 combinations of music excerpts and video clips selected for their friendly or aggressive meaning. In Exp 1, 36 Ss (mean age 20.9 yrs) judged the semantic congruency of the 32 audiovisual pairs. In Exp 2, 40 Ss (mean age 20.2 yrs) assessed temporal congruency and in Exp 3, 63 Ss (mean age 21.5 yrs) assessed friendly-aggressive video meaning. Results indicate Ss can assess the degree of audiovisual semantic congruency, and their judgements can be predicted from independent ratings of the audio and video components. Ss agree about whether an audio and video pair are temporally congruent or incongruent. Results establish the importance of background music when making judgments about the visual contents of a film. These experiments confirm systematic interactions between visual and auditory channels in the evaluation of visual information. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sought to determine the effect of sequential patterns on evaluations by 346 high school and 190 elementary students of teaching in rehearsal. Ss evaluated a high school choral music director conducting a scripted rehearsal containing 10 sequential patterns of instruction identified in previous research. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 presentations of the taped rehearsal: (1) audio and video; (2) audio only; (3) video only; or (4) script only. Results demonstrated that students rated presentations of script only and audio-video higher; presentations of audio or video only produced lower evaluations, as well as comments indicating frustration in deciding evaluation scores. In addition, patterns beginning with musical information were graded higher than those beginning with directions, those ending in approvals were graded higher than those ending in disapprovals, and those ending in specific reinforcement were graded higher than those ending in nonspecific reinforcement.

AB  - Used 255 freshman college students to study the effects of repeated exposure to a stimulus to determine whether music videos wear out more or less rapidly than music alone and whether certain characteristics of music videos can enhance their resistance to wear out. There were 3 levels of music stimuli (pop song, music video, and edited video without closure) and 3 levels of exposure. Three questions measured Ss' liking for the song, and the Cognitive Response Affective Index assessed cognitive responses as a measure of elaborative thoughts. Relative to the original video, liking declined significantly for those exposed to the pop song, as did the relative level of positive vs negative cognitive elaborations. The proportion of positive cognitive responses diminished sooner in an exposure series for the original video than for the edited video. The relative level of positive vs negative cognitive elaborations mediated the relationship between repeated exposure to a stimulus and attitude judgment.

AB  - Tested a nonspeech McGurk effect that involved event identification. Exp 1 with 13 undergraduates used the discrepant audiovisual tokens of plucks and bows on a cello. Auditory judgments were influenced significantly by the visual pluck and bow stimuli. However, Exp 2, in which speech syllables were used with 13 undergraduates, demonstrated that the visual influence on consonants was significantly greater than the visual influence observed for pluck-bow stimuli. In Exp 3 with 14 undergraduates, visual stimuli consisting of the words pluck and bow were found to have no influence over auditory pluck and bow judgments.

AB  - Studied the effects of sexual content and aggressive content of music videos on viewers' impressions of the videos to assess the potential dangers of music videos with sexual or aggressive content. Ss were 40 university students (mean age 25 yrs). Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups and exposed to either both video and audio components of 30 music videos or the audio component only. The videos were equally divided into selections with neutral, sexual, or aggressive content. For each selection, Ss were asked to indicate their perceptions of the emotions conveyed and their general impressions. Responses were analyzed in relation to the content and medium (i.e., audio plus video or audio only) of the selection. (English abstract) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Manipulated the relative placement of music such that music either accompanied a film scene's outcome and thereby accentuated its affective meaning or foreshadowed the scene and thereby created expectancies about the future course of events. Background music was either congruent or incongruent with the affect of an episode's outcome. When 60 college students recalled the series of filmed episodes, results show that expectancy violations arising from mood-incongruent relations led to better memory in the foreshadowing condition, while mood-congruent relations led to better performance in the accompanying condition. Results from a recognition task reveal that scenes unavailable for recall were recognized when cued by background music. Positive affect consistently produced higher levels of performance than did negative affect. Findings are discussed in terms of selective-attending processes.

AB  - One of the general aims of this book is to specify, as far as possible, the relationships between the characteristics of the sounds which enter the ear and the sensations which they produce. Whenever possible these relationships will be specified in terms of the underlying mechanisms. In other words, we will be trying to understand what the auditory system does and how it works. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

      The most obvious change in the third edition is the addition of a new chapter on the temporal resolution of the ear. However, all of the other chapters have been extensively revised and updated. The most substantial changes are the following: Chapter 1 includes new data on active processes in the cochlea; Chapter 3 describes the phenomena of comodulation masking release and profile analysis; Chapter 6 includes new data on binaural sluggishness and binaural adaptation; Chapter 8 describes several new phenomena in speech perception, including duplex perception, sinewave speech and audiovisual integration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

      This is the third edition of one of the leading textbooks on auditory perception, and is intended to accompany courses in audiology, speech and the hearing sciences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the effects of aural and visual approaches to rhythm reading and short-term retention. 25 second- and 24 sixth-grade students were presented with two-measure rhythm patterns in four modes: (1) audio-rhythm, (2) audio-mnemonics, (3) (audio) visual-rhythm, and (4) (audio) visual-mnemonics. Raw data consisted of the number of trials necessary for the correct performance of the rhythms on a woodblock. Results indicated that the simultaneous use of auditory and visual channels facilitated learning and retention of rhythms at both grade levels. Maturation was significant in the acquisition of rhythms, in that older students learned the patterns twice as quickly as the younger children, regardless of presentation mode. Factors concerning the mnemonics, short-term memory, and the development of music literacy were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated auditory and visual stimulation as potential reinforcers for 6 severely retarded adults (mean chronological age 25.7 yrs, mean mental age 37.2 mo) on a stationary bicycle ergometer, a task that can promote cardiorespiratory fitness. Auditory stimulation consisted of popular music while visual stimulation was flood lights and blinking Christmas tree lights. A modified multiple baseline across Ss design was employed. All Ss peddled for a number of sessions without receiving auditory or visual reinforcement, thus constituting baseline performance. Then, 3 Ss received visual stimulation followed in subsequent sessions by simultaneous audiovisual stimulation while 3 other Ss received auditory stimulation alone prior to simultaneous audiovisual stimulation. While all 6 increased their work output over the 35, 18-min sessions, it is concluded that the reinforcement contingencies were influential in only 4 of the Ss. It is speculated that auditory stimulation may be a more potent motivator than visual stimulation. (32 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the audiotapes, Auditory Demonstration Tapes (1978). Each demonstration tape contains some introductory and explanatory material, but in general it would probably be valuable for the instructor to lay a little groundwork, to anticipate misunderstandings, and so forth by saying a few introductory words. To aid the nonspecialist in psychoacoustics with this task, a booklet of program notes accompanies the set of tapes. Individual demonstrations from this set of tapes should be of value in a wide array of undergraduate psychology courses-introductory, sensation or perception, psycholinguistics, experimental and probably will eventually see use in other departments-speech, linguistics, music, architecture. It is even easy to imagine a high-school science teacher getting good use from some of the demonstrations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Discusses how audio technology distorts the perception of reality. The perception of "now" is blurred when a videotape recording of a newscast is televised. Editing may remove authenticity, changing a real event into a manufactured one. The viewer's reaction to an interview, Presidential address, etc, depends on whether it is live or taped and on whether he knows this. The predestination of a videotaped event yields passive viewer reaction. Audio technological advances have also altered our perception of "perfection." Retaping, splicing, amplification, and other devices can produce recordings closer to perfection than any live performance; among other results, this means that the concert hall and opera house are no longer needed as settings for music.

AB  - Describes 5 successive interventions used in rearing 66 infants in 5 groups at an orphanage in Tehran. Ss were examined every other week during the 1st yr, every 4th wk thereafter, using the 7 ordinal sensorimotor scales of J. C. Uzgiris and J. Hunt. Group 1 (15 Ss) were controls and received only the periodic examinations. The intervention planned for Group 2 (10 Ss) was audiovisual enrichment under the control of the Ss, but was never adequately implemented. Group 3 (10 Ss) received extra untutored human care. Group 4 (20 Ss) received audiovisual intervention plus access to responsive inanimate materials. Group 5 (11 Ss) received attention from caretakers who had been instructed in early learning programs and in fostering vocal imitation and semantic mastery. Each successive group (except the 2nd) achieved the top steps of nearly all the scales at mean ages younger than the preceding group, and the 5th group surpassed even home-reared American children from professional families on 5 of the 7 scales. The findings show that infants need not advance along all branches simultaneously and that the kinds of experience encountered determine the branch along which advancement occurs. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. (55 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Six high school psychology classes experienced 10-, 20-, or 30-min lesson programs presented on 3 screens with audio narration and music (2 classes for each program length). On true-false and multiple-choice tests, all 6 classes scored higher than a control group that did not view any of the programs. The students assigned to the 10-min program scored higher than those who received the 30-min program, but in a retest a week later the difference did not appear. Scores for the 20-min presentation did not differ significantly from scores for either the 10- or 30-min programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper is introduced with a hypothesis, saying that: the development in the present century of the possibilities of transmission, storage, modulation and even creation of music by electroacoustic means has effected a change in the patterns of listening behaviour and of musical behaviour as such. One conspicuous aspect of this change-a pattern of musical behaviour universally spread among the youth and known as beat, rock, etc.-was made the subject of a research study conducted by the International Institute for Music Dance and Theatre in the Audio-visual Media with the assistance of experts from 21 countries. The author does not limit the discussion to the topics of that research project, but also includes questions that are designed to further elucidate the impact of electroacoustics on various patterns of musical behaviour. It should suffice merely to touch upon the phenomena observed by music sociology in order to indicate the areas possibly to be considered when drafting the guidelines for future research in the fields of psycho-acoustics and neuro-psychology.

AB  - Investigated in 2 experiments the effect of different types of competing auditory tasks on laterality differences in visual perception. 12 right-handed Ss were presented with digits which occurred randomly in the left or right visual fields. Ss responded vocally to previously specified digits in a go, no-go reaction time situation. In the absence of any competing auditory task, digits presented in the right visual field were processed more quickly. This visual field difference in reaction time was in the same direction while Ss performed a secondary musical task. However, when a secondary verbal task had to be performed, digits in the left visual field received faster responses. Results support the view that the right hemisphere is capable of some language functions, and that hemispheric differences in performance have at their basis a quantitative asymmetry, which can be reversed by overloading their limited capacity.

AB  - Studied the use of various music and related audiovisual activities to aid in the development of functional speech in 6 institutionalized severely retarded males. Results indicate that correct functional speech can be acquired at a relatively fast rate by the institutionalized severely retarded using music therapy procedures. That a variety of audiovisual stimuli along with music facilitates such a learning change is also indicated by a comparison of experimental and control group results over the 12 treatment sessions. Results support findings reported in the literature that the more pleasurable and varied the stimuli which are paired with appropriate verbal behavior, the greater will be the learning change for the institutionalized mentally retarded. It is concluded that the varied uses of music as a positive stimulus offer an effective and expedient medium for the therapist in developing and shaping verbal behavior in the institutionalized mentally retarded.

AB  - In a follow-up (see 30: 3385) it is found that children taught by the experimental method involving instrumental music the preceding year, but since exposed to the usual music program for one year, remained better than a control group in terms of knowledge of musical rotation. The fifth, but not the fourth grade experimental group performed better than the controls on a test of audio-visual musical discrimination. No difference was found on the Keston Music Preference Test, although one had been found immediately following the experimental teaching. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
