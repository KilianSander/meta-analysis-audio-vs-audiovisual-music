AB  - The success of creative products depends on the felt experience of consumers. Capturing such consumer reactions requires the fusing of different types of experiential covariates and perceptual data in an integrated modeling framework. In this article, the authors develop a novel multimodal machine learning framework that combines multimedia data (e.g., metadata, acoustic features, user-generated textual data) in creative product settings and apply it to predict the success of musical albums and playlists. The authors estimate the proposed model on a unique data set collected using different online sources. The model integrates different types of nonparametrics to flexibly accommodate diverse types of effects. It uses penalized splines to capture the nonlinear impact of acoustic features and a supervised hierarchical Dirichlet process to represent crowd sourced textual tags, and it captures dynamics via a state-space specification. The authors show the predictive superiority of the model with respect to several benchmarks. The results illuminate the dynamics of musical success over the past five decades. The authors then use the components of the model for marketing decisions such as forecasting the success of new albums, conducting album tuning and diagnostics, constructing playlists for different generations of music listeners, and providing contextual recommendations.

AB  - Synaesthesia is a phenomenon where sensory 'fusion' occurs resulting in, for example, 'seeing' music or 'hearing' colours, making it of great interest in human-computer interaction for creating new or enhanced experiences and interactions in virtual worlds. In virtual reality, research has mainly focused on evaluating advanced graphics and capturing immersion levels and user experience within 'typical' and 'expected' interactions. This paper investigates how multimodal design characteristics can lay the foundations to a more 'synaesthetic' design approach in mixed reality to identify how 'atypical' interactions can also affect user experience. Twenty participants completed a maze activity, emotion and immersion surveys and interviews. Analysis on expressed sentiments and correlations suggest that space, timing and user location qualitatively interplay in determining these. Design approaches need to take into consideration a more holistic design model to enrich mixed reality with 'fused' user experience accounting for space, time, artefacts, location, physicality, virtuality, cognition and sentiments.

AB  - The targeted use of music within the framework of a therapeutic relationship has become an established part of a multimodal treatment concept in most clinics. The article presents the psychodynamic music therapy from a clinical perspective. The theoretical principles, current research data and selected case examples are described. It illustrates how music therapy uses musical parameters to identify conflicts, structural level and relational patterns and to confront maladaptive relationship patterns with interventions. By using various music-specific techniques and other techniques based on psychotherapeutically oriented procedures, patients can make new experiences of object relations. Increased research on the effectiveness of music therapy led to its confirmation as an evidence-based treatment, which is reflected in the recommendations in the S3 guidelines for various disorders.

      Abstract (German)
      Der gezielte Einsatz von Musik im Rahmen einer therapeutischen Beziehung hat sich als Bestandteil eines multimodalen Behandlungskonzeptes in den meisten Kliniken etabliert. Der Beitrag stellt die psychodynamische Musiktherapie aus der Perspektive klinischen Arbeitens vor. Es werden theoretische Grundlagen, aktuelle Forschungsdaten und ausgewahlte Fallbeispiele beschrieben. Illustriert wird, wie die Musiktherapie musikalische Parameter nutzt, um Konflikte, Strukturniveau und Beziehungsmuster zu identifizieren sowie maladaptiven Beziehungsmustern mit Interventionen zu begegnen. Durch den Einsatz von unterschiedlichen musiktherapiespezifischen und an anderen psychotherapeutischen Verfahren orientierten Techniken konnen Patient*innen neue Beziehungserfahrungen machen. Fur die Wirksamkeit der Musiktherapie liegt zunehmend empirische Evidenz vor, was sich auch in den Empfehlungen der S3-Leitlinien fur verschiedene Storungsbilder widerspiegelt.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our lives in unimagined ways, families are reinventing daily rituals, and this is likely true for musical rituals. This study explored how parents with young children used recorded music in their everyday lives during the pandemic. Mothers (N = 19) of child(ren) aged 18 months to 5 years living in the United States played the role of home DJ over a period of one week by strategically crafting the sonic home environment, based on resources provided by the authors, in response to their children's mood and state. Using a newly developed data collection tool, inspired by the Experience Sampling Method, a total of 197 episodes were collected about children's engagement with recorded music. Findings showed that while mothers utilized music to fulfill various emotional needs, they tended to use it to maintain or reinforce their child's positive mood rather than to improve a negative mood. Also, mothers' reports suggested various ways that young children engaged with music, being aligned with the multimodal nature of their musical experiences. Lastly, mothers reported that their strategic approaches to use recorded music seemed to help their children feel less distressed and happier, and this, in turn, aided in the reduction of some of the burdens associated with parenting.

AB  - Learning to play a musical instrument involves mapping visual + auditory cues to motor movements and anticipating transitions. Inspired by the serial reaction time task and artificial grammar learning, we investigated explicit and implicit knowledge of statistical learning in a sensorimotor task. Using a between-subjects design with four groups, one group of participants were provided with visual cues and followed along by tapping the corresponding fingertip to their thumb, while using a computer glove. Another group additionally received accompanying auditory tones; the final two groups received sensory (visual or visual + auditory) cues but did not provide a motor response-all together following a 2 x 2 design. Implicit knowledge was measured by response time, whereas explicit knowledge was assessed using probe tests. Findings indicate that explicit knowledge was best with only the single modality, but implicit knowledge was best when all three modalities were involved.

AB  - The study investigates how transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the auditory cortex (AC) modulates memory for melodies under different noise conditions, whilst also considering cumulative disruptive interference effects. Forty-one participants completed a continuous recognition melody task, as well as a visual control task, which included four noise conditions for which noise was either present only during encoding (N-C), only during retrieval (C-N), during both (N-N) or not at all (C-C) and completed the tasks after receiving anodal or sham tDCS over the right AC. The results of the sham session replicate previous findings by revealing that memory for melodies is worse when noise in added to the encoding phase (N-C) whereas the N-N condition shows good performance, highlighting a context effect, and that cumulative disruptive interference is not present in memory for melodies except in the N-C condition. After anodal stimulation the memory pattern differs such as that memory performance is best in the C-C condition and furthermore the cumulative disruptive interference effect in the N-C condition is diminished. In sum, the study highlights the involvement of the right AC for memory for melodies and the results indicate an association of the AC for creating context effects.

AB  - Performing an opera requires singers on stage to process mental imagery and theory of mind tasks in conjunction with singing and action control. Although it is conceivable that the precuneus, as a posterior hub of the default mode network, plays an important role in opera performance, how the precuneus contributes to opera performance has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of the precuneus to singing in an opera. Since the precuneus processes mental scenes, which are multimodal and integrative, we hypothesized that it is involved in opera performance by integrating multimodal information required for performing a character in an opera. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the functional connectivity of the precuneus during imagined singing and rest. This study included 42 opera singers who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging when performing "imagined operatic singing" with their eyes closed. During imagined singing, the precuneus showed increased functional connectivity with brain regions related to language, mirror neuron, socio-cognitive/emotional, and reward processing. Our findings suggest that, with the aid of its widespread connectivity, the precuneus and its network allow embodiment and multimodal integration of mental scenes. This information processing is necessary for imagined singing as well as performing an opera. We propose a novel role of the precuneus in opera performance.

AB  - Humans negotiate unpredictable environments every day. Responding to and engaging with new situations and rule-sets as and when they arise is quotidian, not a new or outlandish phenomenon. Interplay of object and meaning, interpretation via deduction and assumption, testing our theories and asking "what if I...?" in multimodal 3D environments happens in museums, galleries, concert halls and amusement parks but also in regular human interaction. There are no contexts that lack variables: we enlist templates that contain possibility spaces over scripts that forbid them. The phenomenon of the template-the signifying structure that stands in for the content-provides extremely fertile ground for an artistic praxis that seeks structural experimentation. The template is fallible in its incompleteness, humble in its neutral identity and aims of accessibility, and at the same time lifeless without human engagement and awesome in the multitude of possible branches it possesses. A template is a composed space that invites addition, subtraction, transformation, and reorganization. As participants in such composed spaces we are often unaware of the potential we possess as co-composers, as players. My work asks all those present to consider their significance as co-composers, as players in music spaces. In this portfolio of new works I draw on recent play research and explore composed possibility spaces for music experiences. I engage aspects of ritual, role and boundary in four new intermedial works: Situation #1: Agency (for Players, Explorer and Guide), Situation #2: Human Forms (a self-guided sound-sculpture audio tour), Situation #3: Interstices (for audience members, electronics, video and percussionist), and Metanoia: A Journey in 6 Scenes (a virtual environment for singers, percussion and single interacting player).

AB  - Professional musicians are a popular model for investigating experience-dependent plasticity in human large-scale brain networks. A minority of musicians possess absolute pitch, the ability to name a tone without reference. The study of absolute pitch musicians provides insights into how a very specific talent is reflected in brain networks. Previous studies of the effects of musicianship and absolute pitch on large-scale brain networks have yielded highly heterogeneous findings regarding the localization and direction of the effects. This heterogeneity was likely influenced by small samples and vastly different methodological approaches. Here, we conducted a comprehensive multimodal assessment of effects of musicianship and absolute pitch on intrinsic functional and structural connectivity using a variety of commonly used and state-of-the-art multivariate methods in the largest sample to date (n = 153 female and male human participants; 52 absolute pitch musicians, 51 non-absolute pitch musicians, and 50 non-musicians). Our results show robust effects of musicianship in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity in both structural and functional networks. Crucially, most of the effects were replicable in both musicians with and without absolute pitch compared with non-musicians. However, we did not find evidence for an effect of absolute pitch on intrinsic functional or structural connectivity in our data: The two musician groups showed strikingly similar networks across all analyses. Our results suggest that long-term musical training is associated with robust changes in large-scale brain networks. The effects of absolute pitch on neural networks might be subtle, requiring very large samples or task-based experiments to be detected. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Sami are Indigenous peoples of northern Fenno-Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia). While today the political and cultural initiatives of the Sami function both nationally and internationally, the Sami are, and have always been, a group of peoples with their own internal diversity of language, traditions, and lifeways. Similarly to many other Indigenous groups around the world, colonization and exploitation have affected the Sami, and their homeland Sapmi, since the seventeenth century. Popular genres of music have since the mid-twentieth century been outlets for protesting the unfair treatment of the Sami, and remain vibrant modes of expression today, used to voice challenges against institutionalized colonialism and the stereotypes and expectations of Indigeneity.Previous scholars in musicology and anthropology have focused their research mostly on the iconic Sami vocal tradition of joik or reindeer husbandry. However, this dissertation is concerned with how contemporary popular music and multimedia productions by and about Sami artists, whether they include these explicit ethnic markers or not, engage in forms of decolonial activism or protest, particularly in relation to Sami conceptions of intersectional ethnicity and gender. Sami popular music now exists in a variety of multimedia forms, such as music videos, social media content and discourses, feature films, and multimodal activist collaborations with other Indigenous musicians and activists around the world. In these venues, the artists challenge ethnic and gendered assumptions, practice global Indigenous networking and solidarity, and contribute to goals expressed by the Sami Parliaments such as language and cultural revitalization, environmental protection, and suicide prevention. Online and digital networks created by Indigenous activists often lead to collaborations in the corporeal world as well, where musicians and other artists collaborate as parts of larger projects and festivals. This dissertation examines the overlaying structures and issues, as well as several case studies, of each of these types of multimedia expressions, and provides insight into the topics, aesthetics, and political causes that are relevant to Sami artists making music in twenty-first century Fenno-Scandinavia.

AB  - The study consists of two parts. Part one examined the clinical use of the multimodal neurologic enhancement music therapy intervention (MNE) in the NICU and compared clinical outcomes of infants who received MNE with those who did not. A post hoc analysis was utilized to examine clinical data of infants from 2018 who were hospitalized in a single NICU unit. Subjects (N = 530) were infants born preterm, which is defined as less than 37 weeks postmenstrual age. Demographics were compared between the infants who did and did not receive NICU-MT. There was a significant difference between the groups with infants receiving NICU-MT being born younger and at a lower birthweight, and with more acute diagnoses indicating referral for NICU-MT going to more acute preterm infants.In order to compare clinical outcomes, the researcher matched infants based on sex, gestational age at birth, birthweight category, number of acute diagnoses, diagnoses of bronchopulmonary disease, and diagnoses of a feeding problem. Clinical outcomes for the matched infants (n=55 in each group) were compared between the two groups, showing that infants who received NICU-MT went home sooner, gained more weight per day, and ended oxygen treatment sooner. The benefits of NICU-MT were the greatest for infants born extremely preterm or at an extremely low birthweight. Part two was a two-year follow-up study that examined developmental outcomes in the domains of communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and socio-emotional skills of infants at two years of age who received MNE in the NICU compared to normative data for term infants. Subjects (N = 30) were toddlers who were born premature (<37 weeks), hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth, and received the MNE intervention. Parents completed developmental questionnaires about their toddlers who were two years adjusted age.Developmental outcomes were measured using two standardized developmental questionnaires. The Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition, (ASQ-3) was used to assess overall developmental outcomes (Squires, 2009). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social & Emotional, 2nd edition, (ASQ:SE2) was used to assess behavioral and social-emotional outcomes (Squires et al., 2015). Outcomes on the ASQ-3 showed that the majority of follow-up infants were in the no- to low-risk category in all domains of communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social skills. The follow-up infants exhibited better outcome scores than did the normative sample on the ASQ:SE2 with a lower median score and fewer infants identified as being at high risk for a social-emotional delay. Regression analyses indicated that the number of MNE intervention sessions did not significantly predict the outcome scores for any domain on the ASQ-3 or the total score on the ASQ:SE2. However, the number of music therapy sessions did significantly predict the outcome scores on the communication and fine motor domains (p < .05) in the multiple linear regression analyses. These outcomes warrant the need for further research on the potential long-term impacts of NICU-MT interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research towards a new approach to the abstract symbol grounding problem showed that through model counting there is a correspondence between logical/linguistic and coordinate representation in the visuospatial domain. The logical/verbal description of a spatial layout directly gives rise to a coordinate representation that can be drawn, with the drawing reflecting what is described. The main characteristic of this logical property is that it does not need any semantic information or ontology apart from a separation into symbols/words referring to relations and symbols/words referring to objects. Moreover, the complete mechanism can be implemented efficiently on a brain inspired cognitive architecture, the Activation Bit Vector Machine (ABVM), an architecture that belongs to the Vector Symbolic Architectures. However, the natural language fragment captured previously was restricted to simple predication sentences, with the corresponding logical fragment being atomic Context Logic (CLA), and the only actuation modality leveraged was visualization. This article extends the approach on all three aspects: adding a third category of action verbs we move to a fragment of first-order Context Logic (CL1), with modalities requiring a temporal dimension, such as film and music, becoming available. The article presents an ABVM generating sequences of images from texts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This dissertation examines cultural adaptations of transnational television series as a means to study how media globalization plays out at the local/national level. Through a critical perspective, the study investigates if and how cultural adaptations contribute to the maintenance of the politico-cultural status quo and discusses their potential for disrupting existing ideological formations by inspiring the audience to engage in critical self-reflections.Focusing on contemporary localized versions of global television in Turkey, the study explores how cultural adaptations perpetuate existing relations of power, especially amidst intense socio-economic transformation. The study particularly scrutinizes the ways in which cultural adaptations of television dramas, one of the most popular TV genres in Turkey, affirm or challenge cultural norms of authority and gender.Using multimodal critical discourse analysis as its analytical framework, the dissertation offers a comprehensive study comprising quantitative and qualitative data from cultural adaptations of six television series and compares them with their traveling other. By tracing the textual and narratological divergences between the remakes and their source texts, with a particular focus on dialog, camerawork, narrative structure, musical score, and mise-en-scene, it investigates how issues of power and gender are reconfigured and articulated idiosyncratically at the local level. Analysis of global television texts and the localization process enables the researcher not only to study the local particularities of cultural globalization in the making but also to reveal the global remaking of the local. The findings offer new insights into how culture, politics and media intersect in the construction of varying narratives of national identity, gender and power relations.

AB  - Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication skills, including motor control, emotional facial expressions, and eye gaze / joint attention. This Ph.D. dissertation focuses on studying the feasibility and effectiveness of using a social robot, called NAO, and a toy music instrument, xylophone, at modeling and improving the social responses and behaviors of children with ASD. In our investigation, we designed an autonomous social interactive music teaching system to fulfill this mission.A novel modular robot-music teaching system consisting of three modules is presented. Module 1 provides an autonomous self-awareness positioning system for the robot to localize the instrument and make a micro adjustment for the arm joints to play the note bars properly. Module 2 allows the robot to be able to play any customized song per user's request. This design provides an opportunity to translate songs into C-major or a-minor with a set of hexadecimal numbers without music experience. After the music score converted robot should be able to play it immediately. Module 3 is designed for providing real-life music teaching experience for the users. Two key features of this module are a) "music detection" and b) "smart scoring and feedback". Short-time Fourier transform and Levenshtein distance are adapted to fulfill the design requirements, which allow the robot to understand music and provide a proper dosage of practice and oral feedback to users. A new instrument has designed to present better emotions from music due to the limitation of the original xylophone. This new programmable xylophone can provide a more extensive frequency range of notes, easily switch between the Major and Minor keys, extensively easy to control, and have fun with it as an advanced music instrument. Because our initial intention has been to study emotion in children with autism, an automated method for emotion classification in children using electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. The time-frequency analysis of the acquired raw EDAs provides a feature space based on which different emotions can be recognized. To this end, the complex Morlet (C-Morlet) wavelet function is applied to the recorded EDA signals. The dataset used in this research includes a set of multimodal recordings of social and communicative behavior as well as EDA recordings of 100 children younger than 30 months old. The dataset is annotated by two experts to extract the time sequence corresponding to three primary emotions, including "Joy", "Boredom", and "Acceptance". Various experiments are conducted on the annotated EDA signals to classify emotions using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The quantitative results show that emotion classification performance remarkably improves compared to other methods when the proposed wavelet-based features are used. By using this emotion classification, emotion engagement during sessions, and feelings between different music can be detected after data analysis.NAO music education platform will be thought-about as a decent tool to facilitate improving fine motor control, turn-taking skills, and social activities engagement. Most of the ASD youngsters began to develop the strike movement within the two initial intervention sessions; some even mastered the motor ability throughout the early events. More than half of the subjects could dominate proper turn-taking after few sessions. Music teaching is a good example for accomplishing social skill tasks by taking advantage of customized songs selected by individuals. According to researcher and video annotator, majority of the subjects showed high level of engagement for all music game activities, especially with the free play mode. Based on the conversation and music performance with NAO, subjects showed strong interest in challenging the robot with a friendly way. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although neglect is known to be a multimodal deficit, current interventions often address the visual modality only. Experimental studies, however, found that neglect patients can partially overcome their spatial inattention temporarily when being exposed to auditory cues that move towards the neglected side of space. Two pilot studies investigated the impact of dynamic auditory cueing on egocentric neglect severity in a clinical-therapeutic setting. In both studies, the patient groups received 15 sessions of intervention. Study 1, designed as double-blinded trial with a historical control group, targeted severely impaired early-acute patients who listened to music or audio books which were presented as moving dynamically from right to left. Results showed a reduction in egocentric neglect severity that persisted after therapy termination in the intervention but not in the historical control group. In study 2, based on the comparison with reported effect sizes of previous studies, dynamic meaningful auditory cues and optokinetic stimulation were combined in a computer-based training. Both studies found a significant reduction of neglect severity. Results provide evidence for the reduction of egocentric neglect severity after repetitive auditory cueing therapy in both severely and moderately impaired patients. Our promising findings should be verified thoroughly in randomized-controlled trials. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper contributes to the Business Ethics literature by unpacking the multimodal construction of moral narratives in popular culture and its portrayals of organizations and organizational roles. Understanding such portrayals and their construction is crucial to Business Ethics scholarship because they shape organizational imaginaries, influencing understandings and expectations of the ethical/moral responsibilities of organizations and the actors within them. In particular, we study the construction of moral narratives within a reality TV show that focuses on immigration and border control at an airport. We find that the immigration officers are depicted as rational and heroic figures whilst the travellers are presented as emotional and potentially dangerous characters. Our analysis highlights how this is achieved via five multimodal editing dimensions-the structure of interactional scenes, the ability to address the camera, the narrator's comments, the visual and music effects-that are key in constructing clearly defined personae. We show how, through the intersubjective construction of clear-cut characters, the show downplays the moral complexity of its content. Portraying immigration officers as heroic, while presenting travellers as potentially dangerous, allows for a silencing of any ethical questioning of immigration officers' organizational practices.

AB  - Previous research illustrates the collaborative nature of adolescents' multimodal composing processes. However, few studies have specifically focused on how different modes influence student interactions over time. This study examines how multiple modes (e.g. text, music, visuals, and animations) mediated middle schoolers' composing processes as they worked in small groups to create multimodal science fictions. Situated in an afterschool program, each student selected the role of writer, scientist, or designer. Data sources included screen capture video, semi-structured interviews, and multimodal products. Qualitative data analysis involved the constant comparative method to establish codes for types of interactions and the mediating modes as a case study small group collaboratively composed. Findings indicate: (1) students were inclined to provide short responses to move on with composing practices; (2) group discussions while multimodal composing followed three stages: mode and story exploration, mode-story integration, and mode-story completion; (3) multimodal comics fostered the most discussion; (4) different modes supported self-oriented and group-oriented contributions in unique ways. This study contributes an initial understanding into how different modalities mediate students' interactions and offers implications for scaffolding peer interactions during multimodal composing processes.

AB  - This qualitative study, based on data from an ongoing after-school literacy and songwriting initiative, examines the multiliteracy practices of Noriah Rose and Koral, Black adolescent girls, and their socially situated meaning-making and sharing about loss. Specifically, we asked, "In what ways do youth grapple with complicated meanings of loss as they share creative and artistic songwriting practices?" We build upon interdisciplinary framings in literacy and social science research to advance new theoretical understandings of literary practices of remembrance, highlighting the public sharing of independently authored digital compositions across various audiences through song. We conceptualize youths, enacting literacy practices of remembrance, as demonstrating three socially situated stances of sharing: evoking a passed-on narrative complicating temporality and permanence, historicizing artistic cultural expression, and demonstrating mutual sharing and stewardship of loss. We argue that various communities supported youths' meaning-making about loss, and we offer implications for teaching, research, and practice.

AB  - "Music" is a special case of sound: as opposed to a noise, or noise-textures (e.g., wind, fire crackling, etc.), musical sounds have a particular structural organization in both the time and in the frequency domain. By virtue of its fundamental structural principles (pulse and scale), music immediately allows several individuals to produce sounds together. Making music together in a group, that is, joint synchronized action, is a potent elicitor of social bonding, associated with the activation of pleasure-, and sometimes even "happiness-"circuits in the brain. At its core, music is not a cultural epiphenomenon of modern human societies, but at the heart of what makes one human, and thus deeply rooted in the brain. Engaging in music elicits a large array of cognitive and affective processes, including perception, multimodal integration, attention, social cognition, memory, communicative functions (including syntactic processing and processing of meaning information), bodily responses, and-when making music-action. By virtue of this richness, it is presumed that there is no structure of the brain in which activity cannot be modulated by music, which would make music the ideal tool to investigate the workings of the human brain. This chapter reviews the neuroscientific research findings about some of these processes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Professional dancers were video recorded dancing with the intention of expressing melancholy, grief, or fear. We used these recordings as stimuli in two studies designed to investigate the perception and sociality of melancholy, grief, and fear expressions during unimodal (dancing in silence) and multimodal (dancing to music) conditions. In Study 1, viewers rated their perceptions of social connection among the dancers in these videos. In Study 2, the same videos were coded for the amount of time that dancers spent in physical contact. Results revealed that dancers expressing grief and fear exhibited more social interactions than dancers expressing melancholy. Combined with the findings of Warrenburg (2020b, 2020c), results support the idea that-in an artistic context-grief and fear are expressed with overt emotional displays, whereas melancholy is expressed with covert emotional displays.

AB  - Speech and music emerge from a spectrum of nested motor and perceptual coordination patterns across timescales of brief movements to actions. Intuitively, this nested clustering in movements should be reflected in sound. We examined similarities and differences in multimodal, multiscale coordination of speech and music using two complementary measures: We computed spectra for envelopes of acoustic amplitudes and motion amplitudes and correlated spectral powers across modalities as a function of frequency. We also correlated smoothed envelopes and examined peaks in their cross-correlation functions. YouTube videos of five different modes of speaking and five different types of music were analyzed. Speech performances yielded stronger, more reliable relationships between sound and movement compared with music. Interestingly, a cappella singing patterned more with music, and improvisational jazz piano patterned more with speech. Results suggest that nested temporal structures in sound and movement are coordinated as a function of communicative aspects of performance.

AB  - Background Evidence is scarce regarding the analgesic effect of music for the relief of acute pain during the care of surgical tibial fracture wounds. Objective To evaluate the analgesic effect of music on acute procedural pain during the care of surgical tibial fracture wounds. Method This was a randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial with 70 patients in the immediate postoperative period for diaphyseal tibial fracture surgery. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: a control group (CG), in which patients received only the institution's standard analgesia, and an intervention group (IG) composed of patients receiving a 30-min session of music of their own choice, as a complementary method to the institution's standard analgesia. Pain was evaluated during the first postoperative dressing change, using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Results The sample was homogeneously composed of men (91.4%), young adults (61.4%), without previous diseases (88.6%) and whose traumas were related to a motorcycle crash (84.3%). The main musical genres chosen by participants were the most popular in their region (61.4%). Those who listened to music presented lower pain scores when compared with those in the CG (IG:2.4 +/- 2.4 versus CG:5.8 +/- 2.7; p < 0.001; eta2 = 0.171; p < 0.001). Conclusion Listening to music is effective for relieving acute procedural pain during the first post-operative tibial fracture dressing change. Music should be incorporated into the multimodal analgesia protocols for management of orthopedic postoperative wound care-related pain. Significance Patients with diaphyseal tibial fractures that listened to music before and during the wound dressing change showed less pain when compared to those who received the standardized pharmacologic analgesia alone.

AB  - Aims and Objectives: To describe what is known from the existing literature on nonpharmacological interventions targeting pain in patients admitted to the ICU. Background: Patients receiving intensive care nursing are exposed to a wide range of pain provoking tissue damage, diseases, surgery and other medical procedures in addition to the pain caused by nursing care procedures. The present shift to light sedation to improve patient outcomes and comfort underscores the need for effective pain management. Opioids are the mainstay for treating pain in the ICUs, whereas nonpharmacological treatments are understudied and possibly under-used. Method: A scoping review was undertaken using five of the six steps in the Arksey and O'Malley framework: (a) identification of the research question, (b) identification of relevant studies, (c) study selection, (d) charting the data and (e) collating, summarising and reporting the results. CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, BMJ Best Practice, British Nursing Index and AMED databases were searched using relevant keywords to capture extensive evidence. Data were analysed using the six-step criteria for scoping reviews suggested by Arksey and O'Malley for data extraction. To ensure quality and transparency, we enclosed the relevant Equator checklist PRISMA. Results: Our search yielded 10,985 articles of which 12 studies were included. Tools for pain assessments were VAS, NRS, ESAS and BPS. Interventions explored were hypnosis, simple massage, distraction, relaxation, spiritual care, harp music, music therapy, listening to natural sounds, passive exercise, acupuncture, ice packs and emotional support. Reduction in pain intensity was conferred for hypnosis, acupuncture and natural sounds. Conclusion: The findings support further investigations of acupuncture, hypnosis and listening to natural sounds. Relevance to Clinical Practice: The main finding suggests the use of comprehensive multimodal interventions to investigate the effects of nonpharmacological treatment protocols on pain intensity, pain proportion and the impact on opioid consumption and sedation requirements.

AB  - In efforts to gain a deeper understanding of how technologies can provide alternative ways for people to learn how to play a musical instrument, this dissertation explores how digital games can inspire and foster music learning with the support of online communities in which people gather to learn, share, and collaborate. These communities have been defined in the literature as affinity spaces (Gee, 2018), a concept that builds upon Lave and Wenger's (1991) framework of communities of practice and highlights their informal and interest-driven features. This qualitative study uses both discourse analysis and multimodal analysis to examine how people discuss learning to play the guitar by using the PlayStation 4 game Rocksmith with the support of an online affinity space dedicated to this game. The research question for this study is: How do people discuss learning to play the guitar through Rocksmith in an online affinity space?In order to answer this research question, user posts were collected from the official online discussion forum dedicated to the game and analyzed using discourse analysis and multimodal analysis in order to identify how people discuss learning to play music through playful technologies (such as the Rocksmith game) with the support of a dedicated online affinity space.

AB  - The relation between language and emotions may seem obvious-one uses language to communicate and express emotions as well as reflects on the emotionally invested speech of other people. This chapter explores the subtleties of the relationship between language, music, and emotion in terms of expression and performativity by analyzing a widely known genre of oral poetry: ritual wailing poetry. Specifically, it focuses on Karelian laments. As folklore scholars, the chapter approaches oral poetry as sung performances during which the singer creates her poem on the spot, improvising on the basis of traditional conventions of one particular genre. The chapter gives a description of the spectrum of emotions that Karelian laments convey. It analyzes the expression of emotion: both preexisting and emerging in performance and its embodiment and appearance. The chapter discusses variation in the intensity of emotion during the performance of lament. It concludes with a discussion of how emotion is displayed, audible and interpretable in the performance, on one hand, and, on the other, how these multimodal expressive features of a lament influence the emotionality of the performance.

AB  - Background: People with dementia are at greater risk of being admitted to hospital where care may not be tailored to their needs. Interventions improving care and management are vital. Aim: Assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve the care and management of people with dementia in hospital. Method: Six medical and trial registry, and grey literature databases were searched (1999-1998/2018). Search terms included "Dementia," "Hospital," and "Intervention" and limited to experimental designs. Interventions designed to improve the care and management of people with dementia in the general hospital setting were examined. Outcomes included behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), psychosocial, clinical, staff knowledge, and length of hospital stay. The CASP tools, Cochrane risk of bias tool, and GRADE system assessed methodological quality and certainty of evidence. Results: 9003 unique citations were identified; 24 studies were included. Studies were limited in study design and their conduct was at a risk of bias. There is very low-quality evidence that multisensory behaviour therapy reduces BPSD. There is low-quality evidence that a multidisciplinary programme reduces postoperative complications and that robot-assisted therapy, music therapy, multimodal-comprehensive care, person-centred care, and family-centred function-focused care interventions improved staff knowledge, competence, efficacy, and communication. No studies reported reduced length of stay. Conclusions: Whilst we found that these interventions improved the care and management of people with dementia in hospital, it was low- to very low-quality evidence. New clinical recommendations cannot be made based on current evidence, and robust trial designs are necessary to inform evidence-based care.

AB  - Learning to play and perform a music instrument is a complex cognitive task, requiring high conscious control and coordination of an impressive number of cognitive and sensorimotor skills. For professional violinists, there exists a physical connection with the instrument allowing the player to continuously manage the sound through sophisticated bowing techniques and fine hand movements. Hence, it is not surprising that great importance in violin training is given to right hand techniques, responsible for most of the sound produced. In this paper, our aim is to understand which motion features can be used to efficiently and effectively distinguish a professional performance from that of a student without exploiting sound-based features. We collected and made freely available a dataset consisting of motion capture recordings of different violinists with different skills performing different exercises covering different pedagogical and technical aspects. We then engineered peculiar features and trained a data-driven classifier to distinguish among two different levels of violinist experience, namely beginners and experts. In accordance with the hierarchy present in the dataset, we study two different scenarios: extrapolation with respect to different exercises and violinists. Furthermore, we study which features are the most predictive ones of the quality of a violinist to corroborate the significance of the results. The results, both in terms of accuracy and insight on the cognitive problem, support the proposal and support the use of the proposed technique as a support tool for students to monitor and enhance their home study and practice.

AB  - Background: Stories written under musical induction allow studying symbolic figures emerging during the psychotherapeutic process. During multimodal arts psychotherapy, based on a combination of active music therapy and the production of stories under musical induction, the archetype of the alter ego frequently appears in texts written by adolescents. This archetype shows its different facets during the psychotherapeutic process. Methods and research questions: With the help of a qualitative study, based on the phenomenological content analysis of the TAT and the stories written under musical induction with N=52 students suffering from emotional (subgroup I) or conduct disorders (subgroup D), we answered the following questions: * Can we recognise in these symbols compensatory features regarding the person's initial problems? * Do they gradually expand during the therapeutic progress, so that they reflect the integration of the hidden and split parts of the self? * What is generally their role in the adolescents' search for identity, beyond the realm of the pathology? Results: The results of the study opened psychotherapeutic perspectives for tertiary prevention in adolescence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To this day, the study of the substratum of thought and its implied mechanisms is rarely directly addressed. Nowadays, systemic approaches based on introspective methodologies are no longer fashionable and are often overlooked or ignored. Most frequently, reductionist approaches are followed for deciphering the neuronal circuits functionally associated with cognitive processes. However, we argue that systemic studies of individual thought may still contribute to a useful and complementary description of the multimodal nature of perception, because they can take into account individual diversity while still identifying the common features of perceptual processes. We propose to address this question by looking at one possible task for recognition of a "signifying sound", as an example of conceptual grasping of a perceptual response. By adopting a mixed approach combining qualitative analyses of interviews based on introspection with quantitative statistical analyses carried out on the resulting categorization, this study describes a variety of mental strategies used by musicians to identify notes' pitch. Sixty-seven musicians (music students and professionals) were interviewed, revealing that musicians utilize intermediate steps during note identification by selecting or activating cognitive bricks that help construct and reach the correct decision. We named these elements "mental anchorpoints" (MA). Although the anchorpoints are not universal, and differ between individuals, they can be grouped into categories related to three main sensory modalities - auditory, visual and kinesthetic. Such categorization enabled us to characterize the mental representations (MR) that allow musicians to name notes in relationship to eleven basic typologies of anchorpoints. We propose a conceptual framework which summarizes the process of note identification in five steps, starting from sensory detection and ending with the verbalization of the note pitch, passing through the pivotal role of MAs and MRs. We found that musicians use multiple strategies and select individual combinations of MAs belonging to these three different sensory modalities, both in isolation and in combination.

AB  - Dancers and musicians are experts in spatial and temporal processing, which allows them to coordinate movement with music. This high-level processing has been associated with structural and functional adaptation of the brain for high performance sensorimotor integration. For these integration processes, adaptation does not only take place in primary and secondary sensory and motor areas but also in tertiary brain areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), providing vital resources for highly specialized performance. Here, we review evidence for the role of these brain areas in multimodal training protocols and integrate these findings into a new model of sensorimotor processing in complex motor learning.

AB  - Spontaneous rhythmical movements, like foot-tapping and head-bobbing, often emerge when people listen to music, promoting the enjoyable sensation of 'being in the groove'. Here we report the first experiment to investigate if seeing the music maker modulates this experience. Across trials we manipulated groove level in the audio beats (high vs low), and manipulated the match between the audio beats and a concurrently observed point-light display (PLD) of the drummer. The visual display was either fully corresponding with the audio beats, or incompatible across three conditions: a static PLD, a corresponding but asynchronous PLD (0.5s time shifted); or a non-corresponding PLD (e.g. high groove audio paired with low groove PLD). Participants (n = 36) rated: (a) their desire to move; and (b) their perceived groove, purely in response to the audio beats, using 8-point Likert scales. The main effects of groove level and visual display were significant in both measurements. Ratings increased for high compared to low groove audio overall, and for the fully corresponding condition compared to the other visual conditions. Ratings of the desire to move also increased in the static compared to the non-corresponding condition, and the two-way interaction was significant. Desire to move significantly increased for high compared to low groove audio in the fully corresponding, static and asynchronous conditions, while this effect was absent in the non-corresponding condition. These findings identify the importance of seeing as well as hearing the musician for an enhanced experience of groove, which necessitates a multimodal account of music perception.

AB  - Purpose: Research has shown that observing hand gestures mimicking pitch movements or rhythmic patterns can improve the learning of second language (L2) suprasegmental features. However, less is known about the effects of hand gestures on the learning of novel phonemic contrasts. This study examines (a) whether hand gestures mimicking phonetic features can boost L2 segment learning by naive learners and (b) whether a mismatch between the hand gesture form and the target phonetic feature influences the learning effect. Method: Fifty Catalan native speakers undertook a short multimodal training session on two types of Mandarin Chinese consonants (plosives and affricates) in either of two conditions: Gesture and No Gesture. In the Gesture condition, a fist-to-open-hand gesture was used to mimic air burst, while the No Gesture condition included no such use of gestures. Crucially, while the hand gesture appropriately mimicked the air burst produced in plosives, this was not the case for affricates. Before and after training, participants were tested on two tasks, namely, the identification task and the imitation task. Participants' speech output was rated by five Chinese native speakers. Results: The perception results showed that training with or without gestures yielded similar degrees of improvement for the identification of aspiration contrasts. By contrast, the production results showed that, while training without gestures did not help improve L2 pronunciation, training with gestures improved pronunciation, but only when the given gestures appropriately mimicked the phonetic properties they represented. Conclusions: Results revealed that the efficacy of observing hand gestures on the learning of nonnative phonemes depends on the appropriateness of the form of those gestures relative to the target phonetic features. That is, hand gestures seem to be more useful when they appropriately mimic phonetic features. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Musical performance is a multimodal experience, for performers and listeners alike. This paper reports on a pilot study which constitutes the first step toward a comprehensive approach to the experience of music as performed. We aim at bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches, by combining methods for data collection. The purpose is to build a data corpus containing multimodal measures linked to high-level subjective observations. This will allow for a systematic inclusion of the knowledge of music professionals in an analytic framework, which synthesizes methods across established research disciplines. We outline the methods we are currently developing for the creation of a multimodal data corpus dedicated to the analysis and exploration of instrumental music performance from the perspective of embodied music cognition. This will enable the study of the multiple facets of instrumental music performance in great detail, as well as lead to the development of music creation techniques that take advantage of the cross-modal relationships and higher-level qualities emerging from the analysis of this multi-layered, multimodal corpus. The results of the pilot project suggest that qualitative analysis through stimulated recall is an efficient method for generating higher-level understandings of musical performance. Furthermore, the results indicate several directions for further development, regarding observational movement analysis, and computational analysis of coarticulation, chunking, and movement qualities in musical performance. We argue that the development of methods for combining qualitative and quantitative data are required to fully understand expressive musical performance, especially in a broader scenario in which arts, humanities, and science are increasingly entangled. The future work in the project will therefore entail an increasingly multimodal analysis, aiming to become as holistic as is music in performance.

AB  - The article is focused on advantages of using visual methods in qualitative psychological research of personality. The visual turn is not new for the social sciences. Still, this trend is relatively new for psychology. Currently, visual forms of communication have significantly expanded their influence in all areas of culture. This change has led to a rethinking of the strategy of using various visual data in psychological research. In modern qualitative research, visual data is represented by a variety of cultural instruments, from maps, diagrams and matrices, to photographs, videos, collages and drawings. A comprehensive analysis of this problem requires a multimodal approach, representing a combination of different types of communication (audio, visual, textual) and corresponding types of data (spoken words, music, sounds, written words, images, photographs, maps, videos, etc.). This approach lets us set new research tasks and explore new areas, e.g. emotional and bodily components of personal experience and personal changes. The expansion of the scope of visual methods should positively influence the researcher's ethical choices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper explores the implications of children's out-of-school digital multimodal composing practices on learning and teaching in the formal educational context. It adopts a case study approach where publicly accessible YouTube video productions of three children around the world are examined. Applying a multimodal discourse analysis approach, we analyse the children's videos and discuss what they suggest about the children's literacies and skills. We argue that children's digital multimodal composing practices demonstrate their creativity, critical thinking, and a semiotic awareness. Following the case studies, we discuss how the educators can respond to students' out-of-school literacy activities by creating the 'third space' for learning in schools.

AB  - Background: Considering the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatments, the use of musical interventions as non-drug treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease are strongly recommended. Musical interventions seem to improve the socio-emotional and cognitive functioning of these patients, with benefits increasing when patients are engaged at the motor level. Objective: Our study evaluates the factors that may influence patients' socio-emotional and motor engagement during musical activities, and measures their sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) abilities. Methods: Each participant was asked to tap with a metronomic or a musical rhythm, in the presence of a musician who performed the task with them. The presence of the musician was real (live condition) or virtual (video condition). Two tempi were tested: a slow tempo (inter-onset interval of 800 ms) and a fast tempo (inter-onset interval of 667 ms). Results: Patients spontaneously produced more rhythmic movements in response to the music than to the metronome. However, the consistency and accuracy of sensorimotor synchronization were better with the metronome than with the music, and also better in video than in live condition. These effects were modulated by the tempo of the auditory sequences. Conclusion: These results confirm the importance of the musical context and social interactions on these different performances. By evaluating in parallel the hand sensorimotor synchronization, spontaneous motor and socio-emotional behaviors with quantitative and controlled measurements, this study validates a multimodal approach to evaluate the patients' engagement in a musical task. These initial results open up promising application prospects while providing clinicians and researchers a rigorous methodology for understanding the factors that are at the origin of the therapeutic benefits of musical activities on the behavior and well-being of patients and their caregivers.

      Abstract (French)
      Cette etude vise a examiner les facteurs qui influencent l'engagement socioemotionnel et moteur et la synchronisation sensorimotrice (SSM) pendant une activite musicale chez des patients presentant une maladie d'Alzheimer. La tache consistait a taper avec un rythme metronomique ou musical devant une musicienne realisant la meme tache, qui etait presente physiquement ou virtuellement sur un ecran. Selon nos resultats, les patients produisaient plus de mouvements rythmiques en reponse a la musique qu'au metronome. Cependant, laSSMetait meilleure avec le metronome qu'avec la musique et en presence virtuelle plutot que reelle de la musicienne. Ces donnees confirment l'importance du contexte musical et des interactions sociales sur l'engagement moteur et la synchronisation. En revanche, aucun effet sur l'engagement socio-emotionnel n'a ete observe. En evaluant en parallele la SSM, les comportements moteurs spontanes et socio-emotionnels a partir de mesures quantitatives, cette etude permet de valider une approche multimodale d'evaluation de l'engagement des patients dans une tache musicale. Les perspectives d'applications prometteuses de ce travail mettent a la disposition des cliniciens et des chercheurs une methodologie rigoureuse pour comprendre les facteurs qui sont a l'origine des benefices therapeutiques des activites musicales sur le comportement et le bien-etre des patients et de leurs aidants.

AB  - The temporal pole (TP) is an associative cortical region required for complex cognitive functions such as social and emotional cognition. However, mapping the TP with functional magnetic resonance imaging is technically challenging and thus understanding its interaction with other key emotional circuitry, such as the amygdala, remains elusive. We exploited the unique advantages of stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) to assess the responses of the TP and the amygdala during the perception of emotionally salient stimuli of pictures, music and movies. These stimuli consistently elicited high gamma responses (70-140 Hz) in both the TP and the amygdala, accompanied by functional connectivity in the low frequency range (2-12 Hz). Computational analyses suggested that the TP drove this effect in the theta frequency range, modulated by the emotional valence of the stimuli. Notably, cross-frequency analysis indicated the phase of theta oscillations in the TP modulated the amplitude of high gamma activity in the amygdala. These results were reproducible across three types of sensory inputs including naturalistic stimuli. Our results suggest that multimodal emotional stimuli induce a hierarchical influence of the TP over the amygdala. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigating cues that underpin perceptual judgments of interpersonal coordination has important implications for understanding sociocognitive evaluations of the quality of human interactions. With a focus on musical interpersonal coordination, we conducted 2 experiments investigating the impact of music style, modality of stimulus presentation, rater expertise, and audio/visual stimulus features on ratings of perceived synchrony in improvised duo performances. In the first experiment, participants made synchrony ratings following 10-s excerpts of musical performances, whereas in the second experiment, participants rated longer (up to 1 min) excerpts continuously as the music unfolded. Several consistent results emerged across the 2 experiments, including that participants perceived standard jazz improvisations featuring a regular beat as significantly more synchronous than free improvisations that aimed to eschew the induction of such a beat. However, ratings of perceived synchrony were more similar across these 2 styles when only the visual information from the performance was available, suggesting that performers' bodily cues functioned similarly to communicate and coordinate musical intentions. Computational analysis of the audio and visual aspects of the performances indicated that synchrony ratings increased with increases in audio event density and when coperformers engaged in periodic movements at similar frequencies, whereas the salience of visual information increased when synchrony ratings were made continuously over longer timescales. These studies reveal new insights about the correspondence between objective and subjective measures of synchrony and contribute methodological advances indicating both parallels and divergences between the results obtained in paradigms utilizing global versus continuous ratings of musical synchrony.

AB  - Synchronizing movements with events in the surrounding environment is a ubiquitous aspect of behavior. Experiments studying multimodal integration and rhythmic synchronization tend to focus on how bimodal (e.g., audio-visual) stimuli enhances synchronization performance (i.e., reduced variability) compared with synchronization with its unimodal constituents. As such, it is unclear whether trimodal (i.e., audio-visual-tactile) stimuli may yield additional performance benefits. To address this, we developed a multimodal sensorimotor synchronization assessment that incorporates audio, visual, and vibrotactile stimuli. Results replicate performance improvements with bimodal compared with unimodal stimuli. However, trimodal stimuli yields less, or in some cases no advantage compared with bimodal stimuli. These results demonstrate that in this case, increasing the amount of sensory information beyond bimodal stimuli yields little or no additional performance benefits.

      Impact Statement
      Public Significance Statement-This study contributes to the increasing research in multisensory integration by revealing that an increased amount of sensory information does not necessarily lead to improved performance in rhythmic synchronization.

AB  - The embodied cognition paradigm has stimulated ongoing debate about whether sensory data-including color-contributes to the semantic structure of abstract concepts. Recent uses of linguistic data in the study of embodied cognition have been focused on textual corpora, which largely precludes the direct analysis of sensory information. Here, we develop an automated approach to multimodal content analysis that detects associations between words based on the color distributions of their Google Image search results. Crucially, we measure color using a transformation of colorspace that closely resembles human color perception. We find that words in the abstract domains of academic disciplines, emotions, and music genres, cluster in a statistically significant fashion according to their color distributions. Furthermore, we use the lexical ontology WordNet and crowdsourced human judgments to show that this clustering reflects non-arbitrary semantic structure, consistent with metaphor-based accounts of embodied cognition. In particular, we find that images corresponding to more abstract words exhibit higher variability in colorspace, and semantically similar words have more similar color distributions. Strikingly, we show that color associations often reflect shared affective dimensions between abstract domains, thus revealing patterns of aesthetic coherence in everyday language. We argue that these findings provide a novel way to synthesize metaphor-based and affect-based accounts of embodied semantics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Context: Multimodal analgesic approaches are recommended for intensive care unit (ICU) pain management. Although music is known to reduce pain in acute and chronic care settings, less is known about its effectiveness in the adult ICU. Objectives: Determine the effects of music interventions on pain in the adult ICU, compared with standard care or noise reduction. Methods: This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018106889). Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of music interventions in the adult ICU, with the search terms ["music*" and ("critical care" or "intensive care")]. Pain scores (i.e., self-report rating scales or behavioral scores) were the main outcomes of this review. Data were analyzed using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects method with standardized mean difference (SMD) of pain scores. Statistical heterogeneity was determined as I2 > 50% and explored via subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 1173 participants (60% males; mean age 60 years) were identified. Ten of these studies were included in the meta-analysis based on risk of bias assessment (n = 706). Music was efficacious in reducing pain (SMD -0.63 [95% CI -1.02, -0.24; n = 10]; I2 = 87%). Music interventions of 20-30 minutes were associated with a larger decrease in pain scores (SMD -0.66 [95% CI -0.94, -0.37; n = 5]; I 2 = 30%) compared with interventions of less than 20 minutes (SMD 0.10 [95% CI -0.10, 0.29; n = 4]; I2 = 0%). On a 0-10 scale, 20-30 minutes of music resulted in an average decrease in pain scores of 1.06 points (95% CI -1.56, -0.56). Conclusion: Music interventions of 20-30 minutes are efficacious to reduce pain in adult ICU patients able to self-report. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Music-based interventions have emerged as a promising tool in stroke motor rehabilitation as they integrate most of the principles of motor training and multimodal stimulation. This paper aims to review the use of music in the rehabilitation of upper extremity motor function after stroke. First, we review the evidence supporting current music-based interventions including Music-supported Therapy, Music glove, group music therapy, Rhythm- and music-based intervention, and Musical sonification. Next, we describe the mechanisms that may be responsible for the effectiveness of these interventions, focusing on motor learning aspects, how multimodal stimulation may boost motor performance, and emotional and motivational aspects related to music. Then, we discuss methodological concerns in music therapy research related to modifications of therapy protocols, evaluation of patients and study designs. Finally, we highlight clinical considerations for the implementation of music-based interventions in clinical settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Music is a seemingly complex sound object, but all music is based on temporal regularities. This powerful and central characteristic enables anticipation of events and synchronization to them. Research points to important capacities in humans to process these regularities on the basis of an internal tempo that characterizes each individual. A number of studies among adults, children and infants show that internal tempo efficiently orients attention towards important objects or events. During the first years of life, when this temporal competence develops, young children experience environments replete with multimodal temporal regularities and their own behavior is characterized by temporal regularity. Furthermore, with known social partners, infants and young children partake in interactions whose temporal regularities are made salient, thus facilitating attention to meaningful social experiences that form the basis of emergent forms of social cognition.

      Abstract (French)
      La musique est un objet sonore complexe mais qui repose sur une organisation temporelle tres reguliere. Cette caracteristique forte permet, lorsqu'elle est maitrisee, d'anticiper les evenements et de s'y synchroniser. La litterature scientifique souligne que l'etre humain a une capacite a traiter ces regularites sur la base d'un tempo interne qui caracterise chaque individu. Bon nombre d'etudes chez l'adulte, l'enfant et le bebe montrent que le tempo interne oriente efficacement l'attention vers les objets ou evenements importants. Au cours des premieres annees, pendant lesquelles cette competence temporelle se developpe, le jeune enfant baigne deja dans un milieu riche en regularites temporelles multimodales, en produit de nombreuses et est soutenu dans son developpement par ses partenaires sociaux privilegies. Ces derniers lui proposent des interactions aux regularites temporelles saillantes qui lui permettent d'orienter son attention pour developper ses competences cognitives et sociales.

AB  - In order to promote children's collaborative musical creativity in new digital environments, we need a better understanding not only of the sound production capabilities provided by the new digital tools, but also of the interaction affordances involved. This study focuses on the interactional patterns emerging in children's musical creativity, comparing creative group processes on iPad tablet computers (with GarageBand software) to processes on traditional musical instruments. Both instrumentations were assigned to five groups of four 10-12-year-olds for creating sound landscapes for a "space" movie. The traditional instrument groups' processes were characterized by peer teaching as well as multimodal, improvisatory negotiations with rapid exchanges between the participants, both kinds of processes involving the intertwining of deictic expressions with hands-on musical demonstrations, and clear signs of group flow. By contrast, the tablet groups relied on solitary, parallel planning processes where possible coordinations between the participants took on a more abstract, conceptual form, at a remove from the actual musical ideas and their interplay. Also, there were far fewer signs of group flow than in the traditional instrument groups. In sum, the tablets did not seem to match traditional musical instruments in terms of their interactional and creative affordances. This may be because the traditional instruments offer richer textures of gestural and tactile qualities, visual cues, and spatial anchoring points for facilitating concrete musical interaction, and because the GarageBand software actually requires some reliance on abstract conceptual labels, channelling the participants' attention toward pre-planning rather than hands-on musical play. The results are problematized with a view to our decision to treat the tablet computer as akin to a musical instrument rather than as an action environment of its own.

AB  - Brain-computer music interfaces (BCMIs) may be used to modulate affective states, with applications in music therapy, composition, and entertainment. However, for such systems to work they need to be able to reliably detect their user's current affective state. We present a method for personalised affective state detection for use in BCMI. We compare it to a population-based detection method trained on 17 users and demonstrate that personalised affective state detection is significantly (p < 0:01) more accurate, with average improvements in accuracy of 10.2 percent for valence and 9.3 percent for arousal. We also compare a hybrid BCMI (a BCMI that combines physiological signals with neurological signals) to a conventional BCMI design (one based upon the use of only EEG features) and demonstrate that the hybrid design results in a significant (p < 0:01) 6.2 percent improvement in performance for arousal classification and a significant (p < 0:01) 5.9 percent improvement for valence classification.

AB  - Improvisation is sometimes described as instant composition and offers a glimpse into real-time musical creativity. Over the last decade, researchers have built up our understanding of the core neural activity patterns associated with musical improvisation by investigating cohorts of professional musicians. However, since creative behavior calls on the unique individuality of an artist, averaging data across musicians may dilute important aspects of the creative process. By performing case study investigations of world-class artists, we may gain insight into their unique creative abilities and achieve a deeper understanding of the biological basis of musical creativity. In this experiment, functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional connectivity were used to study the neural correlates of improvisation in famed Classical music performer and improviser, Gabriela Montero. GM completed two control tasks of varying musical complexity; for the Scale condition she repeatedly played a chromatic scale and for the Memory condition she performed a given composition by memory. For the experimental improvisation condition, she performed improvisations. Thus, we were able to compare the neural activity that underlies a generative musical task like improvisation to 'rote' musical tasks of playing pre-learned and pre-memorized music. In GM, improvisation was largely associated with activation of auditory, frontal/cognitive, motor, parietal, occipital, and limbic areas, suggesting that improvisation is a multimodal activity for her. Functional connectivity analysis suggests that the visual network, default mode network, and subcortical networks are involved in improvisation as well. While these findings should not be generalized to other samples or populations, results here shed insight into the brain activity that underlies GM's unique abilities to perform Classical-style musical improvisations.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the neural processing of congruent vs. incongruent affective audiovisual information (facial expressions and music) by means of ERPs (Event Related Potentials) recordings. Stimuli were 200 infant faces displaying Happiness, Relaxation, Sadness, Distress and 32 piano musical pieces conveying the same emotional states (as specifically assessed). Music and faces were presented simultaneously, and paired so that in half cases they were emotionally congruent or incongruent. Twenty subjects were told to pay attention and respond to infrequent targets (adult neutral faces) while their EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The face-related N170 (160-180 ms) component was the earliest response affected by the emotional content of faces (particularly by distress), while visual P300 (250-450 ms) and auditory N400 (350-550 ms) responses were specifically modulated by the emotional content of both facial expressions and musical pieces. Face/music emotional incongruence elicited a wide N400 negativity indicating the detection of a mismatch in the expressed emotion. A swLORETA inverse solution applied to N400 (difference wave Incong.-Cong.), showed the crucial role of Inferior and Superior Temporal Gyri in the multimodal representation of emotional information extracted from faces and music. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (superior and medial, BA 10) was also strongly active, possibly supporting working memory. The data hints at a common system for representing emotional information derived by social cognition and music processing, including uncus and cuneus.

AB  - Aim: Tinnitus and hyperacusis are phenomena with a considerable prevalence in the general population, leading to high levels of suffering. It is a symptom that can present itself comorbidly with a variety of psychiatric and medical illnesses. We established a treatment of tinnitus and hyperacusis, which is based on a multimodal approach including a specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) method in an inpatient setting. This approach includes education on tinnitus and hyperacusis, applying coping strategies and techniques of relaxation, directed attention, and music therapy. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach. Materials and Methods: We included retrospective data of 268 patients who underwent tinnitus treatment throughout the 10-year existence of the treatment program. We assessed routine clinical data pretreatment and posttreatment with parameters concerning tinnitus-distress, hyperacusis, and psychological well-being. To determine these variables, we used validated instruments including the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), Questionnaire on Hypersensitivity to Sound (QHS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Results: Patients showed highly significant reduction in all of the examined clinical outcomes. Reduction of TQ, the primary outcome measure, was 15.39 (SD 21.88) from a mean baseline value of 35.72 (p < 0.001). The QHS showed a reduction of 6.72 (SD 8.23) from a mean baseline value of 18.98 (p < 0.001). Moreover, psychological strain was also reduced with high significance, as illustrated in reduction of BSI and BDI-II; reduction in BSI from 49.63 by 24.41 (SD 26.88; p < 0.001) and BDI-II from 16.89 by 7.47 (SD 8.76; p < 0.001). Discussion The multimodal treatment program for tinnitus and hyperacusis including a specific CBT method proves to be a highly effective means of significantly reducing not only tinnitus and hyperacusis but also accompanying distress. Furthermore, it also enables considerable reduction of concomitant psychiatric symptoms such as depression. Conclusions: Our results underline the importance of intensive and multimodal approaches to the treatment of tinnitus and hyperacusis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Prematurity disrupts brain maturation by exposing the developing brain to different noxious stimuli present in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and depriving it from meaningful sensory inputs during a critical period of brain development, leading to later neurodevelopmental impairments. Musicotherapy in the NICU environment has been proposed to promote sensory stimulation, relevant for activity-dependent brain plasticity, but its impact on brain structural maturation is unknown. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that music listening triggers neural substrates implied in socio-emotional processing and, thus, it might influence networks formed early in development and known to be affected by prematurity. Using multi-modal MRI, we aimed to evaluate the impact of a specially composed music intervention during NICU stay on preterm infant's brain structure maturation. 30 preterm newborns (out of which 15 were exposed to music during NICU stay and 15 without music intervention) and 15 full-term newborns underwent an MRI examination at term-equivalent age, comprising diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), used to evaluate white matter maturation using both region-of-interest and seed-based tractography approaches, as well as a T2-weighted image, used to perform amygdala volumetric analysis. Overall, WM microstructural maturity measured through DTI metrics was reduced in preterm infants receiving the standard-of-care in comparison to full-term newborns, whereas preterm infants exposed to the music intervention demonstrated significantly improved white matter maturation in acoustic radiations, external capsule/claustrum/extreme capsule and uncinate fasciculus, as well as larger amygdala volumes, in comparison to preterm infants with standard-of-care. These results suggest a structural maturational effect of the proposed music intervention on premature infants' auditory and emotional processing neural pathways during a key period of brain development.

AB  - Multisensory learning has the potential to facilitate learning outcome. However, visual, auditory, and tactile information can be distractive under certain circumstance, and the effect of their combination has not been fully explored. In two experiments, sixty-four participants read Chinese paragraphs and then answered multiple-choice questions with visual, auditory, and tactile distractions, and their combinations. Distractions were discrete in experiment 1 and continuous in experiment 2. Auditory distraction (deviant sounds and music) increased workload most and slowed down reading speed. Tactile distraction also increased workload, but combing tactile distraction with auditory distractions did not further increase the workload. Although visual distraction alone did not affect workload, combining it with auditory and tactile distractions further increased the workload. Auditory distraction affects reading the most, so we should avoid or mask irrelevant sounds in the learning environment. Multisensory learning protocols should be tested before being put into practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Music is both heard and felt-tactile sensation is especially pronounced for bass frequencies. Although bass frequencies have been associated with enhanced bodily movement, time perception, and groove (the musical quality that compels movement), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In 2 experiments, we presented high-groove music to auditory and tactile senses and examined whether tactile sensation affected body movement and ratings of enjoyment and groove. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 22) sat in a parked car and listened to music clips over sound-isolating earphones (auditory-only condition), and over earphones plus a subwoofer that stimulated the body (auditory-tactile condition). Experiment 2 (N = 18) also presented music in auditory-only and auditory-tactile conditions, but used a vibrotactile backpack to stimulate the body and included 2 loudness levels. Participants tapped their finger with each clip, rated each clip, and, in Experiment 1, we additionally video recorded spontaneous body movement. Results showed that the auditory-tactile condition yielded more forceful tapping, more spontaneous body movement, and higher ratings of groove and enjoyment. Loudness had a small, but significant, effect on ratings. In sum, findings suggest that bass felt in the body produces a multimodal auditory-tactile percept that promotes movement through the close connection between tactile and motor systems. We discuss links to embodied aesthetics and applications of tactile stimulation to boost rhythmic movement and reduce hearing damage. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The exponential rise in use of mobile consumer electronics has presented a great potential for research to be conducted remotely, with participants numbering several orders of magnitude greater than a typical research paradigm. Here, we attempt to demonstrate the validity and reliability of using a consumer game-engine to create software presented on a mobile tablet to assess sensorimotor synchronization, a proxy of rhythmic ability. Our goal was to ascertain whether previously observed research results can be replicated, rather than assess whether a mobile tablet achieves comparable performance to a desktop computer. To achieve this, younger (aged 18-35 years) and older (aged 60-80 years) adult musicians and non-musicians were recruited to play a custom-designed sensorimotor synchronization assessment on a mobile tablet in a controlled laboratory environment. To assess reliability, participants performed the assessment twice, separated by a week, and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. Results supported the validity of this approach to assessing rhythmic abilities by replicating previously observed results. Specifically, musicians performed better than non-musicians, and younger adults performed better than older adults. Participants also performed best when the tempo was in the range of previously-identified preferred tempos, when the stimuli included both audio and visual information, and when synchronizing on-beat compared to off-beat or continuation (self-paced) synchronization. Additionally, high ICC values (>0.75) suggested excellent test-retest reliability. Together, these results support the notion that consumer electronics running software built with a game engine may serve as a valuable resource for remote, mobile-based data collection of rhythmic abilities.

AB  - Presents a review of the literature on developing the premise for an interdisciplinary approach to pain management by focusing on virtual reality (VR), music, and pain. The authors conducted a PubMed literature search using the terms: VR and pain; music therapy (MT) and pain. The authors presented a total of 53 selected data-based articles. Studies were selected that directly investigated the relationship between music or virtual reality and pain in both healthy and pain-afflicted populations using objective and subjective measures of pain as the primary outcome. Studies that assessed multiple interventions beyond virtual reality or music were excluded. Based on the studies, both VR and MT might contribute to reducing pain through mechanisms that include distraction and demand on attention, mood and emotion regulation, and immersion and engagement. Virtual reality and MT can act as a multimodal pain intervention by activating in turn, sensory-perceptual, action-related, cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes. Future research is needed to explore the mutual contribution of these processes and their effect sizes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As students experience multiliteracies across the curriculum through redefined standards, 21st century learning brings multimodal literacies to the forefront of teaching where educators are being required to use technology in their literacy instruction. When taking a New Literacies approach to meaning making from written text, educators must teach students the skills needed to understand how to navigate multimodal ensembles. With the evolution of literacy development and the rapid changes in technology, many elementary educators do not possess the understanding or ability to integrate multimodal literacies across the curriculum. Therefore, teachers will need to continue to look for research-based practices in order to bring multimodal literacy into the curriculum. Through a qualitative experimental design, this case study investigates how literacy lessons and the functions of individual modes assisted fifth-grade students in their meaning making of multimodal ensembles. This study seeks to provide an understanding of how multimodal ensembles that use modes like image, action, gesture, body posture, sound, text, music, and video can impact students' ability to make meaning.

AB  - Research on teachers' assessments of students' playing within music lessons has mainly focused on verbal (spoken) evaluations of their learning. However, closer exploration of these interactions shows that embodied assessments, that is, those that also include non-verbal, multi-modal features as part of the interaction, are found to be particularly relevant when making assessments in performing domains such as music. The study's aim was to examine the different types of assessments made by teachers of their students' playing, how they were responded to by the student, and the function they served in opening up the learning dialogue. 18 video recordings from one-to-one conservatoire music lessons were analysed and two types of assessments were identified: (1) Explicit, definite assessments that provided a clear statement of the students' playing (e.g., 'excellent', 'very good') that resulted in closing down the learning dialogue; and (2) Performative, instructive assessments that were more complex evaluations of the students' playing (e.g., 'that's closer', 'it's too top heavy') that necessitated further work, thus leading to a more detailed pedagogic interaction. Findings highlight the importance of looking at embodied assessments as essential components to the learning dialogue in music, as well as discussing the implications that the different types of assessments have for opening up and closing learning interaction.

AB  - The educational experiences and outcomes of care experienced children and young people is of longstanding concern. The pervasive inequalities they face suggest that current policies have been unable to respond fully to the complex causes of the problem. This paper reflects on a qualitative study into the educational experiences and aspirations of children and young people who are looked after in Wales. The project worked with care experienced peer researchers and drew on visual, creative and participatory techniques to explore 67 children's and young people's experiences of education and, importantly, their opinions on what could be done to improve it. This multimodal approach allowed space for participants to think through their subjective, mundane, but important, experiences that operate alongside, and interact with, more structural challenges. A range of films, magazines, artwork, and music outputs were developed to ensure that the project recommendations could reach wide and diverse audiences. This paper argues the voices of children and young people need to be given a platform to inform policy and practice. For this to happen researchers need to be creative in their approaches to both fieldwork and dissemination; harnessing the power of the arts to make positive changes in the everyday lives of children and young people.

AB  - The medium of music in a multimodal group-analytical treatment setting is ideally suited as a projection space for fantasies and fears. This can result in emotionally highly complicated situations in music therapy, forming a considerable therapeutic challenge on the grounds of unconscious resistance and transference of intrapsychic tensions in the shape of projective identification. The treatment and eventual resolution of the pathogenic psychodynamic have been documented in a case study from group-analytical music therapy. The description is based on Melanie Klein's concept (1946) of projective identification towards unconscious resistance to the emotional pressure of intrapsychic content. In addition, Wilfred Bion's elaborations (1961/2001) contributed to the analysis of the process. The adequate therapeutic intervention for the successful resolution of the projective identification was continuous containing. The understanding of projectively identifying resistance proved to be essential for the purpose of fear regulation and as a form of communication. Because of intensified resonance while listening or improvising, the medium of music itself acted as a vessel or container, offering the possibility of conscious identification. In dealing with music therapy improvisation, previously unconsciously projected fears were consciously experienced, regulated and led towards understanding in the communicative group process.

      Abstract (German)
      Das Medium Musik eignet sich in einem multimodalen gruppenanalytischen Behandlungssetting hervorragend als Projektionsraum fur Phantasien und Befurchtungen. Dies kann zu emotional hochkomplizierten Situationen in der Musiktherapie fuhren, die aufgrund der unbewussten Abwehr und Ubertragung intrapsychischer Spannungen in Form der projektiven Identifizierung eine grose therapeutische Herausforderung darstellen. Die Behandlung und schlieslich Auflosung der pathogenen Psychodynamik wurde anhand eines Fallbeispiels aus der gruppenanalytischen Musiktherapie dokumentiert. Die Beschreibung erfolgte auf Grundlage des auf Melanie Klein (1946) zuruckgehenden Konzeptes der projektiven Identifizierung zur unbewussten Abwehr bedrangender intrapsychischer Inhalte. Weiterhin dienten die Ausfuhrungen Wilfred Bions (1961/2001) der Analyse des Prozesses. Fur die gelungene Auflosung der projektiven Identifizierung bildete anhaltendes Containing die adaquate therapeutische Intervention. Dabei erwies sich das Verstandnis von projektiv identifizierender Abwehr im Dienst der Angstregulation und als Form der Kommunikation als essenziell. Das Medium Musik wirkte zudem aufgrund verstarkter Resonanzen beim Horen oder Improvisieren selbst im Sinne eines Gefases sprich Containers und bot die Moglichkeit der bewussten Identifikation. Im Umgang mit der musiktherapeutischen Improvisation wurden zuvor unbewusst projizierte Angste bewusst erlebt, reguliert und im kommunikativen Gruppenprozess dem Verstandnis zugefuhrt.

AB  - The ability to perceive and produce music is a quintessential element of human life, present in all known cultures. Modern functional neuroimaging has revealed that music listening activates a large-scale bilateral network of cortical and subcortical regions in the healthy brain. Even the most accurate structural studies do not reveal which brain areas are critical and causally linked to music processing. Such questions may be answered by analysing the effects of focal brain lesions in patients' ability to perceive music. In this sense, acquired amusia after stroke provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neural architectures crucial for normal music processing. Based on the first large-scale longitudinal studies on stroke-induced amusia using modern multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as advanced lesion-symptom mapping, grey and white matter morphometry, tractography and functional connectivity, we discuss neural structures critical for music processing, consider music processing in light of the dual-stream model in the right hemisphere, and propose a neural model for acquired amusia.

AB  - Joint engagement-the sharing of events during social interactions-is an important context for early learning. To date, sharing topics that are only heard has not been systematically documented. To describe the development of auditory joint engagement, 48 child-parent dyads were observed 5 times from 12 to 30 months during seminaturalistic play. Reactions to 4 types of sounds-overheard speech about the child, instrumental music, animal calls, and mechanical noises-were observed before and as parents scaffolded shared listening and after the sound ceased. Before parents reacted, even 12-month-old infants readily alerted and oriented to the sounds; over time they increasingly tried to share new sounds with their parents. When parents then joined in sharing a sound, periods of auditory joint engagement often ensued, increasing from two thirds of 12-month observations to almost ceiling level at the 18- through 30-month observations. Overall, the developmental course and structure of auditory joint engagement and joint engagement with multimodal objects and events are remarkably similar. Symbol-infused auditory joint engagement occurred rarely at first but increased steadily. Children's labeling of the sound and parents' language scaffolding also increased linearly while child pointing toward it rose until 18 months and then declined. Future studies should address variations in the development of auditory joint engagement, whether autism spectrum disorder affects how toddlers share sounds, and the role auditory joint engagement may play in gestural and language development.

AB  - Language and music are multi-modal sensory systems which humans are exposed to on a daily basis. Both of these systems are characterized as possessing syntax, or a set of principles that dictate how the smallest discrete syntactic units (e.g., words or musical notes) can be combined to form larger elements (e.g., sentences or chord progressions). According to the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (Patel, 2003; 2008), these syntactic units in language and music are stored in distinct neural regions from one another, whereas the resources used to process syntax in language are the same as those used to process syntax in music. In the present dissertation, I used behavioral and electrophysiological (eventrelated potentials) methodologies to test the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH) and examine whether cognitive control is used to process syntax in music, and whether intensive prior experience with syntactic management (Experiments 1A and 1B) and auditory processing (Experiment 2) in language and music can influence how cognitive control is engaged during syntactic processing in music. Moreover, I examined whether different syntactic structures within and across language and music engage similar cognitive resources, as well as whether the time course of syntactic processing is similar or different for these structures in language and music (Experiment 3). Chapter 1 sets the theoretical and empirical stage for the experiments reported in Chapters 2-5 in this dissertation. In Chapter 1, I provide a broader theoretical and empirical context for the reported experiments by describing different theories that have been proposed to describe syntactic processing in music and language, including the most prominent and most-frequently tested SSIRH and the executive function perspective, as well as alternative accounts that have been proposed that specify the executive function perspective in terms of attention, working memory, and cognitive control. I also review a wider range of behavioral and neurocognitive studies on syntactic processing in music and language to provide the reader a broader empirical context to position the empirical studies I conducted. Chapters 2 -- 5 are empirical chapters that are written in journal article format. Each of these chapters contains its own General Discussion section in which the theoretical and empirical implications of the experiment(s) are discussed. Chapter 6 is a general conclusion chapter that summarizes the main findings of Chapters 2 -- 5 and provides a more overarching discussion of the theoretical and empirical implications of the experiments conducted for my dissertation, followed by suggestions for future research. Chapters 2 and 3 report Experiments 1A and AB, respectively. In Experiment 1A, Dutch-English bilingual musicians and non-musicians and English monolingual musicians and non-musicians completed an adapted version of the Stroop task in their native language (Dutch and English, respectively) during which the classic color-word Stroop task was paired with the presentation of chord progressions. Bilingual musicians were faster to respond across visually congruent and incongruent trials as compared to the other three groups. As expected, participants were also slower on visually incongruent trials than on congruent trials. However, I did not observe the predicted interference effect, which would suggest that cognitive control is engaged during syntactic processing in music. I also did not observe an effect of prior experience with syntactic management in language, music, or both on how cognitive control is engaged. In Experiment 1B, I explored whether Experiment 1A's lack of interference effect was due to task instructions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cognitive neuroscience has traditionally focused on simple tasks, presented sparsely and using abstract stimuli. While this approach has yielded fundamental insights into functional specialisation in the brain, its ecological validity remains uncertain. Do these tasks capture how brains function 'in the wild', where stimuli are dynamic, multimodal, and crowded? Ecologically valid paradigms that approximate real life scenarios, using stimuli such as films, spoken narratives, music, and multiperson games emerged in response to these concerns over a decade ago. We critically appraise whether this approach has delivered on its promise to deliver new insights into brain function. We highlight the challenges, technological innovations, and clinical opportunities that are required should this field meet its full potential.

AB  - Music training may provide an effective mean of enhancing cognitive function in older adults. However, age-related differences in learning, vision and brain plasticity may limit traditional teaching methods effectiveness for older adult learners. The Maine Understanding Sensory Integration and Cognition Project aimed to develop an economical, older-adult-friendly music intervention. The current study presents the pilot data on the effect of music training on social, emotional, and cognitive function. Results, methodology, and challenges with solutions encountered during implementation of a group music intervention for older adults are reported. Community-based participatory research methods were used to enhance recruitment of socioeconomically diverse older adults and solicit participatory feedback. Thirty-five socioeconomically diverse older adults (Mage = 70, SD = 5.12) completed the program. Participants took part in 12 weekly 1-hr recorder group lessons and underwent comprehensive pre- and postintervention neuropsychological assessments. Teaching manuals designed specifically for older adults were developed to overcome identified learning barriers in music learning. Results indicated improved executive function, global cognition, verbal fluency, and visual memory performance following the intervention, ps < .05. Participants universally reported the group provided valuable socialization and camaraderie. Subjective improvements in cognition, self-efficacy and emotional well-being as a result of participating in the music group were also found. Music training is a cognitively stimulating activity that has real-life applications. The Maine Understanding Sensory Integration and Cognition Project's manualized group intervention may provide an engaging and efficient method to enhance social and cognitive function in older adults.

AB  - Although music therapy has become a widespread approach used in the multimodal treatment of psychosomatic disorders, this is the first study investigating the perception of music-induced emotions (PoMIE) in patients with somatoform disorders. For the purposes of this study, n = 23 patients (PG) with somatoform disorder (F45) were assessed for PoMIE within an experimental design. Additionally, n = 25 healthy controls were included as a control group (CG) matched for age and gender. A questionnaire including the dimensional (valence, arousal) and the discrete (basic emotions) model were applied to assess PoMIE. At t0, the PG gave lower ratings of the emotion happiness, F(1, 48) = 1.24, p < .01, than the CG. Significantly higher ratings of fear were observed in the PG than in the CG. At t1, the PG gave higher ratings of happiness for happy-targeted music stimuli than at t0, t(22) = 2.35, p < .05. Higher ratings of fear in the PG compared to the CG also persisted after inpatient therapy, t(46) = -2.48, p < .05. The results suggest a lower perception of happiness and a higher perception of fear in the PG. A multimodal, inpatient therapy seems to influence the happiness perception of music-induced emotions in PG. The results may inform the further evaluation of music therapy interventions.

AB  - Whole-integer ratios in musical rhythm are culturally universal. The reliable periodicity of rhythm inspired us to determine whether time perception, which is foundational to and inherently less structured than rhythm, is subject to similar biases. We created a random-interval generation task that exploits the nonrandom tendencies in perception and action in order to uncover the structural biases underlying temporal duration perception. Participants listened to and watched an audiovisual suprasecond temporal cue and were asked to subdivide it as randomly as possible in a prescribed number of responses. The results showed that the subdivision probability distributions were distinctly nonrandom, and closely resembled multimodal distributions with a number of equally spaced, symmetrical peaks equal to the number of subdivisions required. These patterns were thus highly periodic and isochronous, despite explicit instructions to act as randomly as possible. We interpreted this bias as an organizing heuristic that divides perceived time into smaller, equal-duration chunks in order to facilitate representation.

AB  - Previous research recognizes the importance of musical experiences on music teacher education. However, current efforts do not provide a comprehensive view of the way their students learn music before starting university. The objective of this study is to portray their musical experiences, identifying the distinctive mechanisms underlying the relationship between practices, repertoires, and training contexts for music learning. A combination of pedagogical, social and musical dimensions, inspired by sociological theories of P. Bourdieu and B. Bernstein, examine the pre-university musical experiences and the mediating role of students' sociocultural origins. Empirically, multimodal information from four Chilean universities (n = 55) was collected through the application of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed using a set of mixed techniques, including descriptive statistics, text mining, and content analysis. Findings reveal relevant associations between practices, repertoires, and learning contexts, especially in terms of the specialized nature of musical training and the habitus and cultural dispositions of practitioners. Particularly relevant is the predominance of informal and non-formal learning contexts and their translation into specific types of learning. These challenge current perspectives and contribute a tool kit for the understanding of the relationship between power and knowledge in future professional teachers.

AB  - This study examines the discursive and artistic expression of Moroccan youth identity politics through the production and consumption of rap music online, particularly on YouTube. Drawing on multimodal discourse analysis (MDA), the study explores textual, visual, and reception modes and discourses of Moroccan rap songs mediated through songs' lyrics, video clips, and user comments on the video sharing platform. Focusing on four levels of discourse, namely, narrative and interpersonal representation, genre, modality, and style, the study examines the following key questions: What are the discourses that emerge from the production, circulation, and consumption of online rap music by Moroccan youth? How do online rap production and reception contribute to identity formation among Moroccan youth? To what extent does online rap music contribute to the development of a progressive and alternative social youth movement that challenges dominant cultural and political power relations?

AB  - Prolonged musical training induces important audio-visuo-motor plastic processes. However, little is known about how the musicians' brain resolves multimodal conflicts while preparing for musical action. We run an electroencephalographic (EEG) investigation on how visual processing for action (score reading) is affected by preceding task-irrelevant piano sounds, usually associated to the same or to a different action. Presentation of an incongruent sound, 100 msec before a musical score with one single note, reduces Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) associated to score reading (N170) localised in the right temporo-parietal junction, as well as ERPs associated to conflict strength (N2) localised in the anterior cingulate cortex, superior and inferior right frontal cortex. These results suggest that listening to task-irrelevant auditory action effects (musical notes) interferes with both higher-order visual and frontal conflict monitoring processes. We conclude that, in the musicians' brain, the automatic translation of musical sounds into motor plans, spread its effects to visually specific processing as well as strategic and amodal action monitoring mechanisms.

AB  - Absolute pitch (AP) refers to the rare ability to identify the pitch of any given tone without an external reference tone. Previous studies have shown that during auditory processing, AP musicians activate the auditory cortex (AC), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and parietal areas of the brain. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that AP is sustained by a widespread functional network. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested this hypothesis by employing a mass-univariate analysis of resting-state functional connectivity within the AC, the PFC, and parietal areas in a large sample of musicians with and without AP (N = 100). AP musicians showed increased functional connectivity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and right superior parietal lobule (SPL). These results provide the first evidence for an AP-specific network characterized by increased functional connections in higher-order cognitive areas. Interestingly, AP was not associated with increases in functional connectivity of the AC, but AP was successfully decoded from functional connectivity patterns in the left AC using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA, also known as multivariate pattern analysis), with group classification accuracy being highest for the left Heschl's gyrus (HG). MVPA can capture fine-grained patterns in the brain connectivity profile of AP musicians, whilst a mass-univariate analysis is sensitive to macroscopic trends in the data. The successful differentiation of AP musicians by MVPA but not by a mass-univariate analysis of connectivity in the AC thus indicates that AP musicians differ in the fine-grained rather than the macroscopic AC function. Based on our findings, and in light of current literature, we propose pitch-label associations, tonal working memory, pitch categorization, and multimodal integration as potential mechanisms underlying the AP ability. This set of psychological functions is controlled by a distributed functional network and a particular AC connectivity pattern only present in AP musicians.

AB  - Late modernity has seen profound changes in the communication of emotion. Emotions are mediated through an array of communication technologies, through the mass media, multimedia and the Internet. Using social media, emotions can be socially constructed more rapidly, often interactively and in ways that are typically less bounded by traditional time-space constraints. Emotive symbols can become remixed, reused and made explicit through emoticons, memes, vlogs, blogs, clips, short music video, lip-syncing and graphic interchange formats (gifs) to potentially large audiences in online communities, or through back channels to individuals or groups. The texts of late modernity are, for the most part, multimodal-combining two or more modes of meaning. This chapter outlines a multimodal semiotic framework to analyse the communication of emotions in filmic media. This work is a response to the emerging needs of children and youth to interpret and communicate emotions in ways that extend well beyond verbal and linguistic forms to encompass everyday digital media production. For example, adolescents today use instant messaging and related online practices as a form of emotional relief, practices that are often multimodal.

AB  - In synesthesia activation in one sensory domain, such as smell or sound, triggers an involuntary and unusual secondary sensory or cognitive experience. In the present study, we ask whether the added sensory experience of synesthesia can aid statistical learning-the ability to track environmental regularities in order to segment continuous information. To investigate this, we measured statistical learning outcomes, using an aurally presented artificial language, in two groups of synesthetes alongside controls and simulated the multimodal experience of synesthesia in non-synesthetes. One group of synesthetes exclusively had grapheme-color (GC) synesthesia, in which the experience of color is automatically triggered by exposure to written or spoken graphemes. The other group had both grapheme-color and sound-color (SC+) synesthesia, in which the experience of color is also triggered by the waveform properties of a voice, such as pitch, timbre, and/or musical chords. Unlike GC-only synesthetes, the experience of color in the SC+ group is not perfectly consistent with the statistics that signal word boundaries. We showed that GC-only synesthetes outperformed both non-synesthetes and SC+ synesthetes, likely because the visual concurrents for GC-only synesthetes are highly consistent with the artificial language. We further observed that our simulations of GC synesthesia, but not SC+ synesthesia produced superior statistical learning, showing that synesthesia likely boosts learning outcomes by providing a consistent secondary cue. Findings are discussed with regard to how multimodal experience can improve learning, with the present data indicating that this boost is more likely to occur through explicit, as opposed to implicit, learning systems.

AB  - The term music refers to structured sounds that are produced by humans as a means of social interaction, expression, diversion, or evocation of emotion. Making music in a group is a tremendously demanding task for the human brain, and it elicits a large array of cognitive (and affective) processes, including perception, multimodal integration, attention, social cognition, memory, and communicative functions, including syntactic processing and processing of meaning information, action, and emotion. This richness makes music an ideal tool to investigate the workings of the human brain. This chapter reviews neuroscientific research findings about some of these processes. Tonal languages rely on a meticulous decoding of pitch information, and both tonal and nontonal languages require an accurate analysis of speech prosody to decode structure and meaning of speech. The assumption of an intimate connection between music and speech is corroborated by the reviewed findings of overlapping and shared neural resources for music and language processing in both adults and children. These findings suggest that the human brain, particularly at an early age, does not treat language and music as separate domains, but rather treats language as a special case of music, and music as a special case of sound.

AB  - One of the most severe types of stroke is locked-in syndrome (LIS) due to the loss of almost all voluntary motor functions and a high mortality rate. The majority of the literature regarding LIS is based on case reports that utilized multidisciplinary interventions focused on improving functional communication and respiratory care with minimal focus on motor retraining. These reports were neither dynamic nor multi-sensory, and the only technology utilized was in the form of augmentative communication. There are additional types of technology frequently used in the general stroke population that can address similar motor deficits that occur in the LIS population. This case report explains an interdisciplinary approach using motor and communication interventions that are multisensory, progressive, multi-modal, and technology- based. The length of stay was 153 days in acute rehabilitation, after which the patient returned home making significant gains in overall function. In this patient, the FIM changes in motor (+42), cognitive (+29) and total change score of (+71) surpassed what was determined to be a minimal clinically important difference. These results suggest that this treatment program and approach may be a key reason why this patient was able to achieve significant functional gains and report improved quality of life.

AB  - Visual communication has been identified as an important area both in research and in practice in health communication. In the context of skin cancer, previous work predominantly focused on the individual contribution of visuals or texts to the effects on comprehension and behavioral intentions. However, communication about skin cancer is usually multimodal -- using more than one type of semiotic messages, such as picture, music, and language, to convey information and meaning. Few studies have examined the relationship between different semiotic messages, such as the congruency between language and picture. In addition, little is known about the effects of multimodal portrayals on attitudes and behavioral intentions. To address the gap in the literature, a study was created to examine the multimodal portrayal of skin cancer in women's popular magazines and the effects of such portrayals on attitudes and behavioral intentions of indoor tanning. The study presented in the dissertation employed mixed research methods and was composed of two studies. The first drew on a lens of multimodal discourse analysis and examined how pictures and texts interactively constructed a multimodal discourse about skin cancer in women's popular magazines. The findings suggested that pictures and texts conveyed two competing discourses about skin cancer. Drawing on the findings of the first study, the second study was created to examine the effects of such multimodal portrayals on attitudes and behaviors. Incorporating a perspective of pictorial superiority effects, the experiment aimed to find out whether visual messages are more powerful than words in shaping people's attitudes and behavioral intentions, especially when words and images are incongruent in terms of message orientation. Overall, findings of the second study revealed that PSE was context-specific and was only observed when picture and text were viewed in isolation. Overall, findings from the experiment did not provide sufficient evidence to support PSE since participants across text-picture combination conditions uniformly reported high levels of intentions of tanning bed uses (6-10 times) in the next three months. Theoretical and practical implications of the two studies were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Animal behavior is an academic discipline of transdisciplinary nature. Comprehending the concepts, methods, and applied aspects of animal behavior requires understanding of other fields in biology such as evolutionary biology, physiology, endocrinology, neurobiology, psychology, and so on. In accordance with rapid development in such academic fields as neuroscience, genomic research, data science, and robotics, just to name a few, animal behavior is also experiencing a renaissance with exciting new lines of research and applications. Information on animal behavior is scattered everywhere, which makes the retrieval of useful information a formidable task. Authoritative and up-to-date accounts on recent discoveries and concepts will be extremely useful. The readers who would benefit from comprehensive provisioning of necessary information should include, first of all, upper-class undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers in biology, psychology, veterinary science, and medicine (especially, psychiatry and neurology). Professionals, academic and nonacademic, in the fields related to animal behavior, such as conservation biologists, zookeepers, park rangers, animal trainers, veterinarians, researchers and practitioners in pest management, nature photographers, secretarial staffs, and so on, would also enjoy having access to the encyclopedic accounts. The first edition of the Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior was published in 2010 and contained a total of 323 chapters in three volumes. Recently the field of animal behavior has exploded to keep pace with rapid changes in complementary disciplines. The need to understand the concepts and discoveries in related fields is mutual. Students and researchers in other fields also require a good reliable source for convenient and comprehensive coverage of information in animal behavior. As more people demand easy access to the field of animal behavior, there is a growing need for an encyclopedia that provides readers of diverse educational backgrounds with a complete collection of both basic and applied information of the field. We have made some changes from the first edition by adding an abstract and in-text citation with up-to-date references listed up in the References section at the end of each chapter. We retained nearly all the chapters from the first edition with a majority of them updated by the original authors. When the original authors were not available, however, the section editors commissioned new authors. The chapter entries were realigned to certain extent as some of the section headings are combined or modified and some new headings were added to accommodate recent developments in the field. This edition has expanded to be: Comprehensive: Information available in one place provides one-stop service; Authoritative: Written by top researchers in the field; Up-to-date: Includes the most recent discoveries and concepts; Transdisciplinary: Make connections to related fields of research; Multimedia-driven: Information disseminated through various media.

AB  - The aim of the study is to investigate morphofunctional circuits underlying musical hallucinations (MH) in a 72-years old female that underwent a simultaneous 18fluoredeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and advanced magnetic resonance (MR) exam. This represents a particular case of MH occurred in an healthy subject, not displaying neurological or psychopathological disorders, and studied simultaneously with a multimodal approach. For the resting-state fMRI analysis a seed to seed approach was chosen. For the task-based fMRI, 4 different auditory stimuli were presented. Imaging findings were compared with data obtained by ten healthy controls matched for age and sex. Neuropsychological evaluation and questionnaires investigating depression and anxiety were also administered. PET findings showed hypermetabolism of: superior temporal gyri, anterior cingulate, left orbital frontal, and medial temporal cortices. Structural MRI did not show macroscopical lesions except for gliotic spots along the uncinate fascicle pathways with an increased cortical thickness for the right orbitofrontal cortex (p = 0.003). DTI showed increased fractional anisotropy values in the left uncinate fascicle, when compared to controls (p = 0.04). Resting-state fMRI showed increased functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left temporal fusiform cortex (p = 0.01). Task-based fMRI confirmed PET findings showing an increased activation of the superior temporal gyrus in all the auditory tasks except for the monotone stimulus, with a significant activation of the left orbital frontal cortex only during the song in foreign language, object of MH. Results on cognitive test did not show cognitive impairment, excepting for the performance on Frontal Assessment Battery where the patient fails in the cognitive domains of conceptualization, sensitive to interference, and inhibitory control. The subject did not show depressive or anxiety symptoms. Summarizing, multimodal imaging analyses in the MH case showed a microstructural alteration of the left uncinate fascicle paralleled by an increased metabolism and functional connectivity of cortical regions that receive left uncinate projections (orbital frontal cortex, and medial temporal cortex). This alteration of fronto-hyppocampal circuits could be responsible of retrieval of known songs even in the absence of real stimuli. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many mobile devices are equipped with video shooting function, and users tend to use these mobile devices to produce user generated content (UGC), and share with friends or the public owing to the popularity of social media. To make the video to be attractive, embedding appropriate background music into the video is a popular way to enrich user experience, but it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task to find music that fits the video. This work proposes to use latent factors to recommend a list of music songs for a given video, in which the recommendation is based on the proposed score function, which involves the weighted average of the latent factors for the video and music. Moreover, we use pairwise ranking to design the objective function, and use stochastic gradient descent to optimize the proposed objective function. In the experiments, we specify two hypotheses and design several experiments to assess the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from different aspects, including accuracy, quantitative research, and qualitative research. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is promising in accuracy and quantitative research. Furthermore, this work provides detailed analysis to investigate the fitness of the background music that recommended by the system through interviewing the subjects.

AB  - Once, human-computer interaction was limited to a privileged few. Today, our contact with computing technology is pervasive, ubiquitous, and global. Work and study is computer mediated, domestic and commercial systems are computerized, healthcare is being reinvented, navigation is interactive, and entertainment is computer generated. As technology has grown more powerful, so the field of human-computer interaction has responded with more sophisticated theories and methodologies. Bringing these developments together, this book explores the many and diverse aspects of human-computer interaction while maintaining an overall perspective regarding the value of human experience over technology. The book is structured into nine parts comprising 44 chapters. Part one covers design issues such as semiotics and human-computer interaction, gender and human-computer interaction, and usability and digital typography. Part two describes design process, which includes agile user-centered design, ethnographic approach to design, and user modeling. Part three discusses user experience, task load and stress, and comparing mobile experience. Part four explores evaluation methods such as usability testing, and remote usability testing. Part five describes Fitts' law, applications of intelligent and multimodal eye-gaze controlled interfaces, and corneal imaging. Part six explores interfaces, which include multisurface environments, a natural language interface for mobile devices, visual query interfaces, and interfaces for music. Part seven discusses interacting with mobile media and natural human-robot interaction. Part eight discusses accessibility. Part nine describes Social Networking and Measuring Attitudes Online: Social Interaction and the Internet. Part ten discusses the viability of online communities and virtual teams for enterprise clients and human-computer interaction and education: designing for technology-enhanced learning experiences. Part XI presents applications such as motor vehicle driver interfaces, improving ad interfaces with eye tracking, and visual analytics for comparing multiple clustering results of bioinformatics data.

AB  - Music videos are popular, frequently aimed at young adult audiences, and easily accessible through online platforms. They often portray specific versions of masculinities and femininities and are increasingly linked to the alcohol industry. This research explored how masculinity, femininity, and alcohol consumption are constructed within four mainstream popular music videos. Critical multimodal discourse analysis was employed to systematically examine dominant meanings across various modes of the videos (lyrics, sound, video, and editing). Two major discourses were identified, namely, extreme consumption and freedom, and together these created "playboy" and "woman-as-object" subject positions. These positions are discussed with reference to hegemonic masculinity, postfeminist culture, and capitalist consumerism and considered in terms of the complex ways in which influential postfeminist and hegemonic discourses obscure the operations of power.

AB  - This paper describes and implements an innovative model for teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) that enhances the decision making process of students considering a major or a career in STEM fields. The model can also be used as a decision making tool for educators interested in stressing the importance of STEM for career enhancement and for society as a whole. The model creates analogies and metaphors for various STEM topics using the contents of popular music videos. Theories of neuroscience, the interdisciplinary study of the nervous system, are used to describe and validate our decision making model. Concepts such as, embodied cognition, mirror neurons and the connection between emotion and cognition, are used to explain how the brain processes the information and multi-modal stimuli generated by our model. The model was implemented using the topic of automated decision processes in robotics and automation with a group of university and high school students and teachers. The impact of the model was evaluated using the National Science Foundation (NSF) frameworks for evaluating informal science projects. The results indicate that the model using symbolic transformation to teach STEM can have a significant impact on students' attitude towards STEM and the decision making process about their careers.

AB  - This qualitative study explored multimodal biliteracy found in the Arizona-Sonora borderland, a region thriving with linguistic and cultural diversity despite having an English-only policy. According to Reyes (2012) biliteracy is to think, speak, read, and write in two or more languages, and there are various modes for reading and writing in the 21st century (Reyes, Acosta, Fierro, Fu, & Zapien, 2017). This dissertation focused on Spanish and English bilinguals. First, I present a literature review (Appendix A) informed by a sociocultural framework (Vygotsky, 1978) for understanding biliteracy as a social practice and valuing language as a resource (Ruiz, 1987). Funds of knowledge (Gonzalez, Moll, Amanti, 2005; Moll, Gonzalez, Amanti, & Neff, 1994) is an important component in framing this qualitative study and applying methods informing an inclusive pedagogy for bilinguals. Subsequently, I go over the photographs and multimodal composition presented in two case studies of Spanish and English bilinguals. The first case study (Appendix B) documents biliteracy in the household and local community of bilinguals through photography. It contributes to previous research by Reyes, DaSilva Iddings, and Feller (2016) and the two themes from their analysis: 1) Expanding definitions of language and literacy and 2) Deepening the understanding of funds of knowledge. The second case study (Appendix C) examines how bilinguals critically and creatively expressed their Spanish and English in a multimodal composition. Thinking critically about literacy meant reflecting on their everyday reading and writing practices as bilinguals, while being creative meant thinking about the various modes of reading and writing in two languages. This moves literacy beyond a monolingual and monomodal practice into one that cultivates diversity for equity in education for bilinguals. I seek an empowering pedagogy for bilinguals by valuing and making space for linguistic and cultural diversity in the classroom. Biliteracy is a valuable contribution to class and the learning process of students with more than one language. The primary purpose of this dissertation, like funds of knowledge, was to develop critical innovations in teaching (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) biliteracy for the 21st century. Findings from the photographs, multimodal compositions, written reflections, and retrospective interviews demonstrate how Spanish and English biliteracy is practiced in various modes (e.g. music, dancing, singing, traditional family recipes, and religious/spiritual altars) in the Arizona-Sonora borderland.

AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies-online and offline-serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purposes of this qualitative study, viewed through the New Literacy Studies (NLS) theoretical lens, were to explore third grade students' literacy practices as they composed multimodal informational texts in a digital writing workshop; and examine how these students composed multimodally in a digital format and what their perspectives were on digital, multimodal composition. An ethnographic case study methodology was applied to explore the participants' experiences with digital, multimodal composition by addressing the following questions: (1) What are the literacy practices surrounding the writing by third grade students within a digital writing workshop? (1a) What are the students' perspectives about working in the digital writing workshop? (1b) How does their writing change, both qualitatively and quantitatively? (2) How do students write multimodally when given the chance? (2a) What are their perspectives on that kind of writing? The findings revealed the participants' writing appeared to be influenced by popular music and culture and the researcher's instruction and their interactions with her---their classroom teacher. Additionally, the findings suggested participants found favor in digital composing and valued communicating multimodally. Third, there were quantitative differences---improvements in students' alphabetic word-based writing---and qualitative differences---there seemed to be the establishment of a collaborative community throughout this project. Moreover, the participants utilized a variety of multimodal elements to craft unique compositions. Finally, when given the opportunity to compose multimodally, the participants took ownership of their work and demonstrated agency as they selected multimodal design elements, produced their digital compositions, and reflected on their choices.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to illustrate individualized clinical practice in music therapy as part of treatment programming for veterans with PTSD. Multidimensional aspects of treatment are referenced through an integrative and multi-modal approach to highlight the coordination of processes in meeting veteran needs and goals. The incorporation of Somatic Experiencing techniques will also be highlighted as a means of promoting stabilization and developing resiliency by increasing awareness of sensate experience to help resolve fixated physiologic states due to traumatic stress. Current trauma models will be reviewed to help explore additional needs for growth in music therapy practice in the treatment of veterans coping with trauma.

AB  - Metaphor has recently been reconceptualised as a fundamental part of the human conceptual system. It can hence be expressed in language but also in other modalities and media of communication, including gesture and body language, sound and music, and film and visuals. In spite of this theoretical landslide, however, the wide range of nonverbal metaphor and its processing has neither been empirically investigated on the same scale nor with the same rigour as metaphor in language. The overarching goal of this book is to report on the findings of a research program aimed at exploiting the vast cognitive linguistic and psycholinguistic expertise on metaphor in language for a new, behaviourally founded approach to the structure and processes of metaphor in one of these nonverbal manifestations, namely static visuals. The book presents concepts and methods for the identification and analysis of metaphor in document structure as well as new approaches to the study of visual metaphor processing. Its results are intended to further the development of an encompassing and robust cognitive-scientific theory of metaphor by including visual metaphor while also enriching our understanding of the communicative possibilities and effects of visual metaphor in multimodal discourse. The chapters present the results of different studies into the areas of visual metaphor it is the outcome of a research program "Visual metaphor: A psycholinguistic perspective. Part I of the book deals with the structure of visual metaphor and explores the way in which visual incongruities invite meaning construction. It analyses what it is in metaphorical images that makes them potential conveyors of meaning 'beyond' their denotation, resulting in a visual semiotics for the resolution of incongruities. Part II of the book deals with aspects of visual metaphor processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article seeks to unveil quantitative relations between the patterns of movement recurrence of a group of expert clarinetists and expressive sonic manipulations they employ during their performances. The main hypothesis is that the recurrent ancillary gestures of musicians are closely related to their sounded expressive intentions, and that the expressive content imposed by them according to the music structure is reflected in their movement patterns. To conduct this multimodal investigation of expressiveness in music, movement and audio analyses of several clarinet performances of excerpts in the classical repertoire are presented and discussed in conjunction. The results show strong correlations between the recurrence pattern of clarinetists' ancillary movements and expressive manipulations of timing, timbre, and loudness associated with melodic phrasing and harmonic and dynamic transitions in the performed music excerpts.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy. of increasing spontaneous expressive language using a modified melodic intonation therapy (MIT) approach with a male participant diagnosed with acquired aphasia and apraxia who was 10 years post onset. Method: A therapeutic protocol consisting of vocal and linguistic tasks was administered. The participant attended two 50-min individual sessions and a 4-hr/week socialization program for three 12-week semesters. Measures of speech and language were administered before intervention and at the completion of each of the 3 semesters. Results: At the completion of the study, the participant demonstrated reduced apraxia of speech as measured by The Apraxia Battery for Adults, Second Edition (Dabul, 2000). He also showed improvements in auditory comprehension skills as measured on the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Evaluation (Goodglass, Kaplan, & Barresi, 2000). His spontaneous utterances were characterized by an increased number of complete sentences and questions. Several language parameters including mean length of utterance, total number of spontaneous (untrained) utterances, and number of different words spoken were also improved as revealed through language analysis. Conclusions: Integration of melodic intonation therapy through the addition of musical elements may result in improved speech and expressive language skills when administered over a 9-month period in conjunction with a group socialization program.

AB  - This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course of auditory, visual, and audiovisual affective processing. Stimuli consisted of naturalistic silent videos, instrumental music clips, or combination of the two, with valence varied at three levels for each modality and arousal matched across valence conditions. Affective ratings of the unimodal and multimodal stimuli showed evidence of visual dominance, congruency, and negativity dominance effects. ERP results for unimodal presentations revealed valence effects in early components for both modalities, but only for the visual condition in a late positive potential. The ERP results for multimodal presentations showed effects for both visual valence and auditory valence in three components, early N200, P300 and LPP. A modeling analysis of the N200 component suggested its role in the visual dominance effect, which was further supported by a correlation between behavioral visual dominance scores and the early ERP components. Significant congruency comparisons were also found for N200 amplitudes, suggesting that congruency effects may occur early. Consistent differences between negative and positive valence were found for both visual and auditory modalities in the P300 at anterior electrode clusters, suggesting a potential source for the negativity dominance effect observed behaviorally. The separation between negative and positive valence also occurred at LPP for the visual modality. Significant auditory valence modulation was found for the LPP, implying an integration effect in which valence sensitivity of the LPP emerged for the audiovisual condition. These results provide a basis for mapping out the temporal dynamics of audiovisual affective processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Technology could represent an ally in easing the formulation of a bond between music therapist and client. So far, both scholars and therapists have claimed that the implementation of technology could be paramount in transforming the client's therapeutic process, beyond representing a new and effective methodology for session analysis. This article proposes the implementation of musical technologies within the daily practice of music therapy, the latter understood as the appropriate field for the application of interactive systems technology, which track the user's movements and transform them into audiovisual and haptic feedback. The article presents an exploratory review of the use of digital instruments, based on motion tracking, in order to develop a new basis for music therapy procedures, and discusses how specific features of digital musical instruments could benefit music therapy sessions. All discussions are set within the framework of embodied cognition. We provide a discussion on how multisensory integration may be used in the treatment of clients with severe cognitive and motor difficulties. We advocate the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the practice of music therapy, and propose future lines of research concerned with the design of multimodal and empowerment-based technologies.

AB  - Background: Rehabilitative stroke interventions based on principles of multimodal stimulation have the potential to profoundly affect neuroplastic processes beyond the sub-acute phase. In order to identify important core mechanisms, there is a need to explore how interventions that combine physical, social, sensory, and cognitively challenging activities are perceived and experienced by the participants. This qualitative study, based on an interpretive interactionist perspective, explored the experiences of stroke survivors who participated in a group-based multimodal rehabilitation program based on rhythm and music. Methods and findings: Within four weeks after completion of the multimodal rehabilitation program, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted on a single occasion with 15 purposively selected individuals (mean age 65, 8 men, 7 women). The interview duration was between 13 and 44 minutes. Qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze data. Three categories were identified, each containing several sub-categories: To be intellectually challenged (energy-consuming activity and coordinating multiple input and output), Perceived therapeutic benefits (motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional and psychological responses), and Pros and cons with social integration (fellowship, competing with others, and instructor characteristics). From these categories, an overall theme was derived: The multifaceted layers of multimodal stimulation. Enjoying music, being part of a group with peers, a skilled instructor, and being able to manage the challenging movements, were related to positive experiences. In contrast, negative experiences were associated with not being able to perform the exercises, and with group members who dominated the conversational space. Conclusion: This study shows that access to a multimodal rehabilitation program with rhythm and music as operating ingredients may contribute to positive experiences for many individuals in a late phase after stroke in terms of motor, cognitive, as well as emotional enhancements. Important components were the music, the social interaction, the challenging exercises, and the skilled instructor. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perceptual learning, improvement in discriminative ability as a consequence of training, is one of the forms of sensory system plasticity that has driven profound changes in our conceptualization of sensory cortical function. Psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of auditory perceptual learning have indicated that the characteristics of the learning, and by implication the nature of the underlying neural changes, are highly task specific. Some studies in animals have indicated that recruitment of neurons to the population responding to the training stimuli, and hence an increase in the so-called cortical "area of representation" of those stimuli, is the substrate of improved performance, but such changes have not been observed in other studies. A possible reconciliation of these conflicting results is provided by evidence that changes in area of representation constitute a transient stage in the processes underlying perceptual learning. This expansion-renormalization hypothesis is supported by evidence from studies of the learning of motor skills, another form of procedural learning, but leaves open the nature of the permanent neural substrate of improved performance. Other studies have suggested that the substrate might be reduced response variability-a decrease in internal noise. Neuroimaging studies in humans have also provided compelling evidence that training results in long-term changes in auditory cortical function and in the auditory brainstem frequency-following response. Musical training provides a valuable model, but the evidence it provides is qualified by the fact that most such training is multimodal and sensorimotor, and that few of the studies are experimental and allow control over confounding variables. More generally, the overwhelming majority of experimental studies of the various forms of auditory perceptual learning have established the co-occurrence of neural and perceptual changes, but have not established that the former are causally related to the latter. Important forms of perceptual learning in humans are those involved in language acquisition and in the improvement in speech perception performance of post-lingually deaf cochlear implantees over the months following implantation. The development of a range of auditory training programs has focused interest on the factors determining the extent to which perceptual learning is specific or generalises to tasks other than those used in training. The context specificity demonstrated in a number of studies of perceptual learning suggests a multiplexing model, in which learning relating to a particular stimulus attribute depends on a subset of the diverse inputs to a given cortical neuron being strengthened, and different subsets being gated by top-down influences. This hypothesis avoids the difficulty of balancing system stability with plasticity, which is a problem for recruitment hypotheses. The characteristics of auditory perceptual learning reflect the fact that auditory cortex forms part of distributed networks that integrate the representation of auditory stimuli with attention, decision, and reward processes.

AB  - This case report is a preliminary observation that seems to show the efficacy of a multimodal training involving cognitive and motor skills as an effective clinical and rehabilitative tool offered to very young children with CHI using a hearing device. A combined approach may in fact enhance the child's overall skills. Further research with better methodological approach is needed to confirm the extent of benefit from specific musical training activities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Jazz musicians rely on different skills than do classical musicians for successful performances. We investigated the working memory span of classical and jazz student musicians on musical and nonmusical working memory tasks. College-aged musicians completed the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale, followed by verbal working memory tests and musical working memory tests that included visual and auditory presentation modes and written or played recall. Participants were asked to recall the last word (or pitch) from each task after a distraction task, by writing, speaking, or playing the pitch on the piano. Jazz musicians recalled more pitches that were presented in auditory versions and recalled on the piano compared with classical musicians. Scores were positively correlated to years of jazz-playing experience. We conclude that type of training should be considered in studies of musical expertise, and that tests of musicians' cognitive skills should include domain-specific components.

Here, we investigated the effect of increased motor practice on perceptual sensitivity in 32 professional musicians of comparable expertise but with different amounts of instrumental practice with piano (10,000 vs. 3000 estimated hours). Stimuli consisted of images of pianists' hands and piano arpeggio sounds. In half of the cases, the piano fingering and piano sounds were congruent, while they were incongruent in the other cases. ERPs were recorded from 128 sites while musicians performed a congruent vs. incongruent discrimination task. A fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), mainly generated within the anterior cingulate cortex, was observed in response to incongruent videos only in pianists. Non-pianist musicians were able to carry out the task (with a worse performance) but exhibited a smaller response-related N400 to incongruent stimuli. Source reconstruction applied to ERP responses to incongruent stimuli indicated a less automatic mechanism for detecting sensory-motor deviance and a greater emphasis on visual rather than on acoustic features in non-pianists. Overall the data suggest a profound difference between the two populations of musicians and advise against considering "expert" populations to include those that undertook only a few weeks/months of training in a new discipline.

AB  - The present study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to identify the neural correlates of audiovisual statistical learning, while disentangling the differential contributions of uni- and multi-modal statistical mismatch responses in humans. The applied paradigm was based on a combination of a statistical learning paradigm and a multisensory oddball one, combining an audiovisual, an auditory and a visual stimulation stream, along with the corresponding deviances. Plasticity effects due to musical expertise were investigated by comparing the behavioral and MEG responses of musicians to non-musicians. The behavioral results indicated that the learning was successful for both musicians and non-musicians. The unimodal MEG responses are consistent with previous studies, revealing the contribution of Heschl's gyrus for the identification of auditory statistical mismatches and the contribution of medial temporal and visual association areas for the visual modality. The cortical network underlying audiovisual statistical learning was found to be partly common and partly distinct from the corresponding unimodal networks, comprising right temporal and left inferior frontal sources. Musicians showed enhanced activation in superior temporal and superior frontal gyrus. Connectivity and information processing flow amongst the sources comprising the cortical network of audiovisual statistical learning, as estimated by transfer entropy, was reorganized in musicians, indicating enhanced top-down processing. This neuroplastic effect showed a cross-modal stability between the auditory and audiovisual modalities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The RAVDESS is a validated multimodal database of emotional speech and song. The database is gender balanced consisting of 24 professional actors, vocalizing lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity, with an additional neutral expression. All conditions are available in face-and-voice, face-only, and voice-only formats. The set of 7356 recordings were each rated 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. Ratings were provided by 247 individuals who were characteristic of untrained research participants from North America. A further set of 72 participants provided test-retest data. High levels of emotional validity and test-retest intrarater reliability were reported. Corrected accuracy and composite "goodness" measures are presented to assist researchers in the selection of stimuli. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is increasing evidence for integrated representation of sensory and motor information in the brain, and that seeing or hearing action-related stimuli may automatically cue the movements required to respond to or produce them. In this study we tested whether anticipation of tones in a known melody automatically activates corresponding motor representations in a predictive way, in preparation for potential upcoming movements. Therefore, we trained 20 non-musicians (8 men, 12 women) to play a simple melody. Then, while they passively listened to the learned or unlearned melodies, we applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M1 to measure motor evoked potentials from the associated finger muscle either preceding or following the onset of individual tones. Our results show that listening to the learned melody increased corticospinal excitability for specific finger muscles before tone onset. This demonstrates that predictable auditory information can activate motor representations in an anticipatory muscle-specific manner, even in the absence of intention to move. This suggests that the motor system is involved in the prediction of sensory events, likely based on auditory-parietal-prefrontal feedforward/feedback loops that automatically prepare predictable sound-related actions independent of actual execution and the associated auditory feedback. Overall, we propose that multimodal forward models of upcoming sounds and actions support motor preparation, facilitate error detection and correction, and guide perception.

AB  - Two experiments examined how affective values from visual and auditory modalities are integrated. Experiment 1 paired music and videos drawn from three levels of valence while holding arousal constant. Experiment 2 included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant. In each experiment, participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations. Experiment 1 revealed a congruency effect in which stimulus combinations of the same extreme valence resulted in more extreme state ratings than component stimuli presented in isolation. An interaction between music and video valence reflected the greater influence of negative affect. Video valence was found to have a significantly greater effect on combined ratings than music valence. The pattern of data was explained by a five parameter differential weight averaging model that attributed greater weight to the visual modality and increased weight with decreasing values of valence. Experiment 2 revealed a congruency effect only for high arousal combinations and no interaction effects. This pattern was explained by a three parameter constant weight averaging model with greater weight for the auditory modality and a very low arousal value for the initial state. These results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Expertise in music has been investigated for decades and the results have been applied not only in composition, performance and music education, but also in understanding brain plasticity in a larger context. Several studies have revealed a strong connection between auditory and motor processes and listening to and performing music, and music imagination. Recently, as a logical next step in music and movement, the cognitive and affective neurosciences have been directed towards expertise in dance. To understand the versatile and overlapping processes during artistic stimuli, such as music and dance, it is necessary to study them with continuous naturalistic stimuli. Thus, we used long excerpts from the contemporary dance piece Carmen presented with and without music to professional dancers, musicians, and laymen in an EEG laboratory. We were interested in the cortical phase synchrony within each participant group over several frequency bands during uni- and multimodal processing. Dancers had strengthened theta and gamma synchrony during music relative to silence and silent dance, whereas the presence of music decreased systematically the alpha and beta synchrony in musicians. Laymen were the only group of participants with significant results related to dance. Future studies are required to understand whether these results are related to some other factor (such as familiarity to the stimuli), or if our results reveal a new point of view to dance observation and expertise.

AB  - Purpose: The burden of caregiving for stroke survivors is well known, but the effect of late stroke rehabilitation on the life situation of informal caregivers is unknown. Here, we assessed changes in the life situation of informal caregivers of stroke survivors enrolled in a multimodal intervention trial. Methods: This controlled study was a questionnaire-based survey accompanying a three-armed randomized controlled trial of 123 stroke survivors. The care recipients of 106 caregivers who chose to participate were assigned to rhythm-and-music-based therapy (R-MT; n = 37), horse-riding therapy (HRT; n = 37), or delayed intervention (control group, n = 32). Perceived changes in the life situation of the caregivers were evaluated with the Life Situation among Spouses after the Stroke Event (LISS) questionnaire before randomization, after the 12-week intervention, and 3 and 6 months later. Results: After the intervention, the change in the median LISS score was significantly higher among intervention caregivers (1.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 8.8]) than controls (1.5 [IQR 8.8] vs. 0.0 [IQR 12.0], p = 0.036). The improvement was maintained at 3 months (1.5 [IQR 9.0] vs. 0.0 [IQR 10.5], p = 0.039) but not at 6 months (p = 0.284). Conclusion: Engaging stroke survivors in multimodal interventions late after stroke appears to have potential to produce gains also in the general life situation of informal caregivers.
